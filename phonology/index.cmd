--{.modern}
The Cantonese phonology by which this dictionary has been organised
is best described as modern (late 20th-century) Hong Kong Cantonese,
although there will be instances where usages
specific to Canton (Guangzhou) have been recorded,
either because they appeared in Williams (1856),
or because they are interesting in their own right.

For the phonology of the Ts(')ing Dynasty Cantonese recorded by Williams,
