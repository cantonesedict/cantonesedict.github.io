--{.modern}
The Cantonese phonology by which this dictionary has been organised
is best described as modern (late 20th-century) Hong Kong Cantonese,
although there will be instances where usages
specific to Canton (Guangzhou) have been recorded,
either because they appeared in Williams (1856),
or because they are interesting in their own right.

For the phonology of the Ts(')ing Dynasty Cantonese recorded by Williams,

####{#labialised-initials .modern} Note on labialised initials

--{.modern}
For characters such as 官 where the main vowel is u~[uː], it is contested
whether the initial is unlabialised (gun~[kuːn]) or labialised (gwun~[kʷuːn]).
Whilst I personally sit in the labialised camp
(per romanisations such as Kwun Tong for 官塘 and Kwu Tung for 古洞),
I have followed standard Jyutping here and used the unlabialised initial.

####{#pre-merger-initials .modern} Note on pre-merger initials

--{.modern}
As noted [in Williams' 1856 introduction](/intro/#initials-ch-ts):
--
""{.williams}
2,~20. The initials _ch_ and _ts_ are constantly confounded, and some
persons are absolutely unable to detect the difference, more frequently
calling the words under _ts_ as _ch_, than contrariwise.
All characters
with the sounds _tsz'_ and _ts(')z'_ are liable to be heard _ch(i/)_ and
_ch(')(i/)_, with a stronger breathing than those properly read _ch(i/)_ and
_ch(')(i/)_.
""

--{.modern}
[Moreover](/intro/#initials-sh-s):
--
""{.williams}
16,~17. The initial _sh_ is called _s_ along the coast;
in the districts of Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]], Sinning [[新寧]] and Sinngan [[新安]],
this obtains to a very great extent;
_shui_ 水, _sh(u:)_ 書, _shuk_ 熟, _sh(a/)ng shing_ 省城, &c. &c.,
being heard _sui_, _s(u:)_, _suk_, and _s(a/)ng sing_, as in the Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] and Amoy [[廈門]]
dialects. The initial _sh_ is a complete shibboleth to the people of
those districts. West of Canton [[廣州]], many are found who change _sz'_
into _s(u:)_, and a large part of the words beginning with _s_ are changed
into _sh_ just the opposite of the usage at Macao [[澳門]].
""

--{.modern}
Indeed modern Cantonese has merged the pairs:
--
=={.modern}
- [ts] (Williams' _ts_) and [tɕ] (Williams' _ch_),
  both [Jyutping z](#initial-z);
- [tsʰ] (Williams' _ts(')_) and [tɕʰ] (Williams' _ch(')_),
  both [Jyutping c](#initial-c); and
- [s] (Williams' _s_) and [ɕ] (Williams' _sh_),
  both [Jyutping s](#initial-s).
==
--{.modern}
But it is not quite as simple as that.
In two decades of personal experience,
I have perceived a *tendency* for speakers to
consistently favour specific initials depending on the vowel afterward:
--
||||{.wide}
''{.modern}
|^
  //
    ; Vowel afterwards
    ;{c=3} Favoured post-merger initials
|:
  //
    , [aː], [ɐ], [ɛː], [e], [iː]
    , [ts]
    , [tsʰ]
    ,{r=2} [s]
  //
    , [ɔː], [o], [uː], [œ], [ɵ]
    ,{r=2} [tɕ]
    ,{r=2} [tɕʰ]
  //
    , [yː]
    , [ɕ]
''
||||
--{.modern}
For example, the modern speaker will prefer:
--
=={.modern}
- [sɛːk̚] over [ɕɛːk̚] for 石;
- [saːŋ tɕʰɔːy] over [ɕaːŋ tsʰɔːy] for 生菜.
==
--{.modern}
These subtleties are not captured by any modern romanisation scheme
that collapses the merged pairs (including Jyutping).

    , The null initial.
      Often [initial ng~\[ŋ\]](#initial-ng) is prepended hypercorrectively
      (e.g. ngaap3 instead of aap3 for 鴨 "duck").
      For literary characters, the null initial is the correct one
      (as opposed to initial ng~[ŋ]) when the tone is dark (陰).
  //
    , 也
    , [j]
    ,{#initial-j} j
    , [__y__ as in __y__e]
    , Williams and some modern linguists take this to be a medial vowel [iː].
  //
    , 華
    , [w]
    ,{#initial-w} w
    , [__w__ as in __w__e]
    , Williams and some modern linguists take this to be a medial vowel [uː].

####{#entering-tones .modern} Note on entering tones

--{.modern}
Cantonese preserves the Middle Chinese correspondence
between the nasal codas [m], [n], [ŋ]
and the unreleased stops [p̚], [t̚], [k̚].
The Middle Chinese entering tone (入聲) is reflected in modern Cantonese
[tone~7 (高陰入)](#tone-7), [tone~8 (低陰入)](#tone-8), and [tone~9 (陽入)](#tone-9).
--
--{.modern}
Whilst entering tones are not tones in a strict phonetic sense,
with some authors casting them as tone~1, tone~3, and tone~6,
it is vital to maintain the distinction because:
--
++{.modern}
1. Pronunciations in olden dictionaries can only be understood
   in terms of the nasal-stop correspondence
   (e.g. 登入聲 in the Kangxi entry for 德); and
2. Tone patterns in poetry (平仄) will be incorrect
   if tone~7 (高陰入) is cast as tone~1 (陰平).
++
--{.modern}
Unfortunately, Jyutping uses tone numbers 1, 3, 6 in place of 7, 8, 9.
I have reluctantly followed Jyutping with its numbering,
but have still used the names 高陰入, 低陰入, and 陽入
to preserve the distinction.
--

####{#tone-changes .modern} Note on tone changes

--{.modern}
Tone changes are a feature of vernacular Cantonese.
These are denoted in this dictionary by appending a hyphen and the new tone number
after the original tone number in the Jyutping romanisation.
--
--{.modern}
Typical examples of tone change are:
--
=={.modern}
- A change to rising tone marking a word as a noun
  (rather than an adjective or verb),
  e.g. 畫 waa6-2 "painting", or 鑿 zok6-2 "chisel"; and

- A change to dark level tone because it sounds better,
  e.g. 今晚 gam1 maan5-1, or 後尾 hau6-1 mei5-1.
==
--{.modern}
Such tone changes are *not* tone sandhi,
because they apply to specific words,
rather than indiscriminately to all words
due to the tone of a word and its surrounding syllables.
--


##{#pronunciation .modern} Note on pronunciation

--{.modern}
Whenever the topic of "correct" Cantonese pronunciation is discussed,
it is important to distinguish between two different phenomena:
--
++{.modern}
1. __"Lazy pronunciation"__ (懶音), which refers to common substitutions
   such as replacing initial n~[n] with l~[l], dropping initial ng~[ŋ],
   or replacing syllabic ng~[ŋ̍] with m~[m̩].
   Correcting "lazy pronunciation" is a largely uncontroversial topic.

2. __"Incorrect reading"__ (錯讀), which refers to incorrect reading of characters
   according to some authority.
   For example, some authorities regard the common reading ming5 for 銘
   as incorrect, with ming4 (per 《廣韻》莫經切) to be used instead.
   Correcting allegedly "incorrect readings" is a highly controversial topic.
