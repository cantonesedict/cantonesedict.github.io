##{#canton} 1. The Canton Dialect

--{.williams}
The dialect of the Chinese language spoken most accurately in
the city of Canton [[廣州]], and hence usually called the Canton Dialect, is
understood throughout the districts in the western half of the province
of Kw(a/)ngtung [[廣東]], with only unimportant exceptions. Though the
variations from the speech of the citizens of Canton itself and from
each other, heard in these districts are numerous, still the general
characteristics of the dialect in its idiom and pronunciation, are
preserved, and the people find little difficulty in talking with each
other. The people from the district of Sinhwui 新會 lying south-\
westerly from Canton, exhibit the most remarkable peculiarities
in pronunciation, and it is a puzzle to the scholars in the city
how they should have originated. The Canton dialect differs so
much from that spoken at the extreme east of the province, in
the department of Ch(a/)uchau 潮州, and in most parts of the adjoining
prefectures of Ki(a/)ying~chau [[嘉應州]] and Hwaichau~f(u/) [[惠州府]], that their
inhabitants are not intelligible to citizens of the capital. This
dialect, usually called the Ti(e/)chi(u/) from the local sound of 潮州,
and the Canton, constitute the speech of probably six sevenths of
the nineteen millions reckoned as the population of the whole province;
still this estimate is based on no very reliable data, owing to
the difficulty of actual examination. The patois known as the _k(a/)k-k(a/)_ [[客家]]
approaches very near to the Canton, and people from Kw(a/)ngs(i/) [[廣西]]
are easily understood in this city. Both the Canton and Ti(e/)chi(u/)
dialects differ so materially in idiom and pronunciation from the
general language of China, called the _kw(a/)n hw(a/)_ 官話 court or
mandarin dialect, that those speaking only the latter do not understand
them; and when they come to Canton as officers, are always
obliged to employ interpreters to explain to them the depositions
made in their courts by the common people.

--{.williams}
[[[Page~x][x] here]]
The variations between the court and Canton dialects, in the
pronunciation of the great body of characters, are so regular as to
enable one to guess with a tolerable degree of certainty, what their
sounds are in the other, the more so because the variations are
chiefly in the finals, and not so numerous in the initials, as is the
case in some of the Fuhkien [[福建]] patois. The unusual changes nearly
all occur in characters having the fourth tone [[入聲 of Middle Chinese, not of modern Mandarin]]. The most common
changes in the finals are here given:---

The frequency of the abrupt consonontal terminations _k_, _p_, and _t_,
in the Canton dialect, immediately strike a northerner from Ki(a/)ngs(u/) [[江蘇]],
who has been used to hear all terminations soft and flowing ; but
the people from those provinces are said to learn this dialect sooner
than those from Amoy [[廈門]] and Fuhchau [[福州]], whose nasal sounds and
greater changes in the initials, are more difficult to accord with it.
Unlike what exists in the province of Fuhkien, here there is not so
great a difference between the language as spoken and read, as to
require almost the acquisition of a double medium.
--

--{.williams}
The variations between the Ti(e/)chi(u/) and Canton dialects consist
in changes in both initials and finals, each having some sounds
which are unknown, or very uncommon in the other. For instance,
the initials _sh_ or _f_ are not found in the Ti(e/)chi(u/), or the initials _b_ [[voiced [b], not voiceless [p]<` `>]],
_lw_, or _mw_ in the Canton; the oblique sound of _(u\)_ in _turn_ is one of
most common finals in the former, and one of the rarest in the latter;
there are no nasal sounds in the Canton, and no words ending with
the finals _i(a/)ng_, _i(a/)k, both of which are common in the Ti(e/)chi(u/).
These differences are among the most noticeable between the two
leading dialects of this provkice, but the variations as one goes from
Ch(a/)uchau~f(u/) [[潮州府]] westward to Canton city, are numberless, nearly every
village exhibiting some peculiarities in the sounds of a few words.
--

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xi][xi] here]]
The standard of pronunciation for the Canton dialect is a small
duodecimo handbook, sometimes issued separately, but more frequently
combined with a letter-writer and forms of invitation, cards,
funeral eulogies, &c., so that one may help to sell the other. It is
called _Kong-(u/) ch(')ik-tuk, Fan-wan ts(')(u")t-i(u/) h(o\)p ts(a/)p_
[[gong wu cik duk fan wan cyut jiu hap zaap]] 江湖尺牘分韻撮要合集
Letters for Travelers and a Collection of
Important Characters divided by their Tones. The preface of the
work is a mere bookseller's recommendation, and gives no hints upon
the motives or principles which guided the compilers in arranging
the characters. It is as follows:---

""""{.williams}
[[See [`id=WO5WAAAAcAAJ` at Google Books][序] for the probable original Chinese.]]

[序]: https://books.google.com/books?id=WO5WAAAAcAAJ&newbks=0&pg=PP5
--
Books giving the sounds of characters, and forms for letter-writers,
are among the most common works in bookstores; but the
largest of them are so cumbrous and bulky as to be troublesome to
refer to, while the smaller kinds are too condensed to be satisfactory
for reference. Consequently, neither of them are well suited for
convenient use. W(u/) Hioh-p(u/) of Y(u/)-sh(a/)n, and Wan K(')i-shih of
W(u/)-k(')(i/) have, however, jointly arranged a collection of words by
their tones, and an assortment of letters for the use of traders in
their travels, which are both comprehensive and brief, giving the
kernel of the matter. The two works assist each other; and as
they are not too large to carry about with one, they are also full and
easy of reference; for as it would be inexpedient to require the purchaser
to get two bulky books at a high price, they are now combined
into a single neat 'sleeve gem,' and arranged on the top and
bottom of the page; so that if one is in doubt respecting the meaning
of a character, he can readily look it up among the classes of
sounds; and if he does not know the exact sound, it will not be
troublesome to gather it from the reading. Thus one part of the
volume will help the other, like a carriage and a boat when one is
traveling by land and water, both having their appropriate uses and
position. Those who are learned will appreciate the propriety of
these remarks. A prefatory note.

--{.williams}
This pocket dictionary is usually bound in four thin volumes, and
sold for twenty-five cents; it contains 7327~characters, and only 175~pages,
or on the average 42~to each page, which plainly shows how
[[[Page~xii][xii] here]]
meagre are the definitions. In comparison with the local vocabularies
used at Amoy and Fuhchau, it is very imperfect, and proves the
ignorance of the compilers of what was wanted for a local dictionary,
or leads one to infer that they did not know how to prepare a
good one. There is no table of initials and finals as in those vocabularies,
nor any list of syllables, by combining which one can get
the proper sound of a character; for he who uses it, strangely enough,
is supposed to know already the sound of the character he is in
search of. The unwritten sounds or colloquial words used by the
people of Canton are nearly all omitted, which is one of the greatest
defects in it, and renders it far less useful to the foreigner who is
learning the dialect than those just spoken of. One reason, probably,
why so little notice is taken of these colloquial words in the Fan Wan [[分韻]]
is the disregard the Cantonese pay to them in their writing, as
no one would degrade his composition by inserting them. This
rejection has had the result of keeping the greater part of them
unwritten, and the compilers of the Fan Wan, knowing no authorized
characters by which to express them, nor having any tabular
system of initials and finals in which to insert them so that the
student could find them, have omitted them. In fact, except in these
two ways, a Chinese actually has no possible means to express
a sound, and the latter mode is so clumsy and unsatisfactory that it
would probably be understood by few natives who use the book.
--

--{.williams}
The adoption of proper characters to denote these unwritten
sounds is a troublesome matter for a native writer, and it is not surprising
that he avoids their use. However, they are occasionally
written, but not all on the same principles. Sometimes a well-known
character of the same tone is selected to express the sound; and its
evidently utter inaptitude in the connection to express any sense is
depended upon to intimate that it is used for a colloquial word.
This expedient is frequently employed by partly educated persons
in letters, when they do not know, or cannot remember the proper
characters. Another device to indicate colloquial words is to prefix
the character _hau_ [[hau]] 口 mouth, or _yan_ [[jan]] 人 a man, at the side of some
well known character of the same sound, but not always of the same
tone. The words _tsoi(6)_ [[zoi6]] a cargo; _(1)k(a/) (2)fo_ [[gaa1 fo2]] 傢伙, furniture;
_(5)mai_ [[mai5]] 咪 do not; _(1)ts(')oi_ [[coi1]] 啋 pshaw! and _(2)t(e/)_ [[de2]] 嗲 remiss, &c., are examples
[[[Page~xiii][xiii] here]]
of this sort, Sometimes, again, a character which comes nearest in
tone is taken to represent the needed sound, and the knowledge of
the reader is expected to inform him that it is employed in a vulgar
sense. The words _(1)n(i/)n_ [[nin1]] 年 milk; _(1)l(a/)n_ [[laan1]] 欄 a bazaar; and _(1)n(a/)i_ [[naai1]] 奶 a lady,
are examples of this practice. Again, characters having
nearly the same meaning as the colloquial word, but of an entirely
different sound, are adopted, so that even if the reader does not know
the vulgar sound he will make no mistake as to the sense. Thus,
the words _(1)hung_ [[hung1]] 烘 to roast, used for _(1)nung_ [[nung1]], to scorch, to scowl;
_[(2)]hung_ [[hung2]] 孔 a hole, used for _(1)lung_ [[lung1]]; are instances of this mode of adaptation.
Lastly, entirely new characters are made for some of them; as
_lat_ [[lat]] 甪 to detach, _p(a/)ng_ [[baang]] 碰 a knock, which of course have no currency
in other parts of China, as neither their sound or meaning
will be known elsewhere. Besides these, there are a few colloquial
words, as _fing_ [[fing]], _kwit_ [[gwit]], _fik_ [[fik]], ap [[ap]], &c., for which no characters can be
found, and which cannot therefore be written at all.
--

--{.williams}
The best course to adopt respecting the colloquial words found
in this dialect, has been a matter of considerable perplexity in the
preparation of this Dictionary. There being so many modes to
express them, it was concluded to follow that plan for each character,
which seemed to be the best understood among the people.
The student must not however place much dependence on many of
the characters employed to denote these unwritten sounds, for they
are not uniformly represented, and other persons would perhaps
choose different characters. The colloquial meanings of a word
are usually distinguished from the more authorized definitions, so
that no trouble will, it is hoped, be found on this score to those who
use the dictionary in other parts of China, where the colloquial is
entirely different.
--

--{.williams}
The characters are classed in the Fan Wan under thirty-three
finals, whose sounds are represented by standard and well known
characters, as given in the annexed Table, all of them in the four
upper tones, except the two last finals. The characters in the second
half have been selected from the body of the book to illustrate the
lower tones, and to aid the scholar in discriminating the two series.
There, are however actually fifty-three finials in the dialect, if we
include the terminations in the fourth tone.

[[[Page~xvi][xvi] here]]
The variations heard in the pronunciation of words under these
thirty-three finals, though rather perplexing, bear only a small proportion
to the whole number of words in the language. The most
usual discrepancies heard under each order are here given, but it is
impossible, and would be useless, to exhibit every alteration from
what the Fan Wan represents as the proper sound. On the whole
that manual may be regarded as a fair exhibition of the general pronunciation.
Other modes of spelling the same sounds, adopted by
Dr.~Morrison, Mr.~Devan and Mr.~Bonney, in their vocabularies of
this dialect, and by others who have tried to write them, are given
in parenthesis under each number.
--

++{.williams}
1.
  _S(i/)n_ [[sin]], s(i/)t [[sit]],
  like _seen_, _seat_, _peat_, _mean_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Several of the words commencing with a vowel,
  as _(i/)n_ [[jin]] 言, _(i/)n_ [[jin]] 現, _(i/)t_ [[jit]] 熱, are heard with
  a nasal or aspirate, as _ng(i/)n_, _h(i/)n_, _ng(i/)t_.
  _(Seen, leet.)_

2.
  _Wai_ [[wai]],
  like _buy_, _nigh_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Words under this final occasionally run
  into the longer sound of _(a/)i_ [[aai]] in the 14th~order, especially in those
  like _kwai_ [[gwai]] and _shai_ [[shai]].
  _(Lei, wī, fy.)_

3.
  _K(i/)_ [[gi, now gei]],
  like _me_, _flee_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  A few words beginning with _k_ [[g]], p [[b]] and _f_ [[f]], are
  frequently heard like the [29th]~final [[e]],
  as _k(i/)_ [[gei]] 騎, _p(i/)_ [[bei]] 俾, _f(i/)_ [[fei]] 非, _k(i/)_ [[gei]] 己,
  pronounced _k(e/)_ [[ge]], _p(e/)_ [[be]], _f(e/)_ [[fe]], or _k(e/)_ [[ge]]; but this is the exception. Others
  having no initial, as (i/) [[ji]] 二, (i/) [[ji]] 耳 are often heard _ng(i/)_.
  _(Tee, she, ki.)_

4.
  _Ch(u")_ [[zyu]],
  like _sue_, or the first part of the word _choose_ [[in Received Pronunciation]]. Words in
  this order beginning with _h_ [[h]], _l_ [[l]], _n_ [[n]], and _ts_ [[z]],
  are often heard sliding into
  _hui_ [[heoi]], _lui_ [[leoi]], _nui_ [[neoi]], _tsui_ [[zeoi]],
  like the 22d~order [[eoi]], as 去, 侶, 女, 聚, 序;
  those under the other initials are less frequently mispronounced.
  _(Kuy, sue, n(u/), loÿ, u.)_

5.
  _Sau_ [[sau]],
  like _now_, _cow_, _how_ [[in Received Pronunciation, but shorter]].
  Words in this order like _au_ [[au]] 漚, 嘔,
  having no initial, often seem to a beginner to lengthen the vowels
  into _(a/)u_ [[aau]], like the 18th~order, as also do those like
  _chau_ [[zau]] 肘 _hau_ [[hau]] 后 and _p(')au_ [[pau]], 剖
  but a little practice will discriminate them.
  _(Tsow, shaw, hāw.)_

6.
  _Tung_ [[dung]], _tuk_ [[duk]],
  like the Irishism _wroong_ for _wrung_, and so nearly
  _toong_, _took_, that it is [doubtful] whether this final ought not to be
  written _t(u/)ng_, _t(u/)k_; it must never be sounded like the English words
  _sung_, _hung_, _tongue_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  There are no variants in this final worth noticing.
  _(Soong, yok, tōk.)_

7.
[[[Page~xvii][xvii] here]]
  _Ying_ [[jing]], _yik_ [[jik]],
  like _sing_, _king_, _quick_, _wing_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  So many words under this order change the final into _eng_ and _ek_,
  that a separate list has been made of them in the general Table of Sounds,
  but the proportion is small;
  all the common words are noticed in the body of the Dictionary.
  At Macao and thereabouts, a large proportion change
  the final into _ang_ [[ang]] and _ak_ [[ak]] of the 15th~order,
  as 兄, 京, 明, 擰, 兵,
  into _hang_ [[hang]], _kang_ [[gang]], _mang_ [[mang]],
  _nang_ [[nang]], _pang_ [[bang]], &c., by which the people from
  Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]] district are recognized at Canton.
  _(Leng, paëng, te-ang, saung.)_

8.
  _Pan_ [[ban]], _pat_ [[bat]],
  like _fun_, _son_, _shun_, _tun_, _won_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never like _man_, _fan_, _hat_, _cat_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Variants in the _yap shing_ [[入聲 yap sing]],
  passing into the long sound _(a/)t_ [[aat]]
  of the 25th~order, are occasionally heard, but a more frequent change
  is into _p(i/)n_, _p(i/)t_, or _pen_, _pet_, which is peculiar to the people of the
  districts of Sinhwui and K(a/)uy(a/)u [[高要]] southwest of Canton.
  _(Pun, kăn, fut, yet, chăt.)_

9.
  _Ch(e/)ung_ [[now zoeng]], _ch(e/)uk [[now zoek]],
  like the combined sounds in _say 'em_ [[in Received Pronunciation]]; there
  is no English word with this diphthong [[now not a diphthong]].
  The variations in this final are rare.
  _(Chaong, cheong, lay-ung, yok, naung, tsay-uk.)

10.
  _Kong_ [[gong]], _kok_ [[gok]],
  like _long_, _song_, _wrong_, _hawk_, _baulk_ [[in Conservative Received Pronunciation]];
  never like _sock_, _lock_ [[in Conservative Received Pronunciation]].
  There is no difficulty in recognizing all words under
  this final, even when as is occasionally the case, they are heard like
  _l(o\)ng_.
  _(Pawng, kawk, l(o/)k, w(o/)ng, hoak, tsoang.)_

11.
  _K(u/)_ [[gu]], _l(o\)_ [[lou]],
  as _coo_, _cuckoo_, _lo_, _hoe_, _flow_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The compilers of the Fan Wan seem to have been unable to distinguish the characters
  under this final into the two terminations of _(u/)_ [[u]] and _(o\)_ [[ou]],
  and have combined them apparently because in the court dialect most of
  them ended in _(u/)_. Those beginning with _l_ [[l]], _m_ [[m]],
  _sh_, and _s_ [[merged into s]] slide
  from _l(u/)_, _m(u/)_, _s(u/)_, _sh(u/)_,
  into _l(o\)_, _m(o\)_, _sh(o\)_, _s(o\)_,
  but under other initials there is
  no trouble in distinguishing them.
  _(Lo, low, ku, foo.)_

12.
  _Chi(u/)_ [[ziu]],
  like _new_, _few_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  both vowels being plainly sounded.
  This final is now and then heard like _(e/)u_ [[eu]],
  as 要 _(e/)u_ for _i(u/)_; 溺 _n(e/)u_ for _ni(u/)_;
  and also sliding into the 4th [[yu]] as 曉 _h(u")_ [[hyu]] for _hi(u/)_ [[hiu]].
  _(Kew, chiu, tee-ue, t(i/)(u/).)_

13.
  _(U")n_ [[jyun]], (u")t [[jyut]],
  like the _u_ in _ruin_, _June_, _jute_, _dilute_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The variations under this final are unimportant, and those are where the vowel is
  changed in a few words to _è_, as 煖 _nèn_ for _n(u")n_ [[nyun]].
  _(Heuet, sh(u/)n, (u/)t, une, sute.)_

14.
[[[Page~xviii][xviii] here]]
  _K(a/)i_ [[gaai]],
  like _aye_, _aisle_ [[in Conservative Received Pronunciation]],
  never shortened into _nigh_, _fly_, like the
  2d~final [[ai]], though that frequently is prolonged into this. The Chinese
  discriminate between the diphthongs _ai_ [[ai]] and _(a/)i_ [[aai]] with much accuracy,
  and the student should pay particular attention to them at first, or
  he will constantly confound them.
  _(Pai, nie, tì, k(a/)i, kye.)_

15.
  _Tang_ [[dang]], _tak_ [[dak]],
  like _tongue_, _sung_, _hung_, _muck_, _luck_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never like _hang_, _bang_, _jack_, _sack_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  There are many words placed under this
  final, which from the constant tendency to lengthen the vowel are
  heard like the 32d~final [[aang]],
  as 生 _sh(a/)ng_ [[saang]] for _shang_ [[sang]], 行 _h(a/)ng_ [[haang]] for _hang_ [[hang]], 北 _p(a/)k_ [[baak]] for _pak_ [[bak]], &c.;
  many of these variations are noticed in the body of the work.
  _(Pung, hăng, tuk, măk, hek, sh(a/)ng, y(a/)k.)_

16.
  _Sz'_ [[si]], _tsz'_ [[zi]],
   like no words in the English language, but much
   like a hiss. The people of Canton itself pronounce these two words
   very clearly, but in the villages around and south of it, they are
   changed into _sh(i/)_, _s(u")_, _sz(u")_, _sch(i/)_, _ts(u")_, _ts(i/)_, _ch(')(i/)_,
   so that in many cases it is hard to recognize them.
   _(Sze, sz, sse, ss', tse.)_

17.
  _Kam_ [[gam]], _kap_ [[gap]],
  like _hum_, _some_, _come_, _sup_, _tup_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never like _ham_, _rap_, nor _came_, _lame_, _nape_, _rape_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  A few words properly referred to this final lengthen the vowel into
  _k(a/)m_ [[gaam]], _k(a/)p_ [[gaap]], like the 24th, and others
  also are changed into short _e_, as _kem_, _nem_.
  _(Yum, shup, lăm[,] shăp.)_

18.
  _K(a/)u_ [[gaau]],
  like _how_ [[in Received Pronunciation]] very much prolonged; the difference between
  this, and the 5th~final [[au]] is merely in the longer sound of the _(a/)_ [[aa]].
  There are no variations in pronunciation worth noticing in this final.
  _(Pow, kaou, chaow.)_

19.
  _Tsoi_ [[zoi]],
  like _boy_, _noise_, _loiter_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The _oi_ in some of the words referred to [in] this final,
  inclines to _ui_ [[eoi]] of the 22d, as 來 內 台 _lui_, _nui_, _t[(')]ui_,
  for _loi_, _noi_, _t[(')]oi_, but a little care will easily discriminate
  them; most of the words are uniformly sounded.
  _(Toy, suy.)_
