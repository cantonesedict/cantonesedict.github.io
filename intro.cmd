##{#canton .williams} 1. The Canton Dialect.

--{.williams}
The dialect of the Chinese language spoken most accurately in
the city of Canton [[廣州]], and hence usually called the Canton Dialect, is
understood throughout the districts in the western half of the province
of Kw(a/)ngtung [[廣東]], with only unimportant exceptions. Though the
variations from the speech of the citizens of Canton itself and from
each other, heard in these districts are numerous, still the general
characteristics of the dialect in its idiom and pronunciation, are
preserved, and the people find little difficulty in talking with each
other. The people from the district of Sinhwui 新會 lying south-\
westerly from Canton, exhibit the most remarkable peculiarities
in pronunciation, and it is a puzzle to the scholars in the city
how they should have originated. The Canton dialect differs so
much from that spoken at the extreme east of the province, in
the department of Ch(a/)uchau 潮州, and in most parts of the adjoining
prefectures of Ki(a/)ying~chau [[嘉應州]] and Hwaichau~f(u/) [[惠州府]], that their
inhabitants are not intelligible to citizens of the capital. This
dialect, usually called the Ti(e/)chi(u/) from the local sound of 潮州,
and the Canton, constitute the speech of probably six sevenths of
the nineteen millions reckoned as the population of the whole province;
still this estimate is based on no very reliable data, owing to
the difficulty of actual examination. The patois known as the _k(a/)k-k(a/)_ [[客家]]
approaches very near to the Canton, and people from Kw(a/)ngs(i/) [[廣西]]
are easily understood in this city. Both the Canton and Ti(e/)chi(u/)
dialects differ so materially in idiom and pronunciation from the
general language of China, called the _kw(a/)n hw(a/)_ 官話 court or
mandarin dialect, that those speaking only the latter do not understand
them; and when they come to Canton as officers, are always
obliged to employ interpreters to explain to them the depositions
made in their courts by the common people.

[[[Page~x of the original]{#page-x}[x] here]]
The variations between the court and Canton [[廣州]] dialects, in the
pronunciation of the great body of characters, are so regular as to
enable one to guess with a tolerable degree of certainty, what their
sounds are in the other, the more so because the variations are
chiefly in the finals, and not so numerous in the initials, as is the
case in some of the Fuhkien [[福建]] patois. The unusual changes nearly
all occur in characters having the fourth tone [[入聲 of Middle Chinese, not of modern Mandarin]]. The most common
changes in the finals are here given:---

The frequency of the abrupt consonontal terminations _k_, _p_, and _t_,
in the Canton [[廣州]] dialect, immediately strike a northerner from Ki(a/)ngs(u/) [[江蘇]],
who has been used to hear all terminations soft and flowing ; but
the people from those provinces are said to learn this dialect sooner
than those from Amoy [[廈門]] and Fuhchau [[福州]], whose nasal sounds and
greater changes in the initials, are more difficult to accord with it.
Unlike what exists in the province of Fuhkien, here there is not so
great a difference between the language as spoken and read, as to
require almost the acquisition of a double medium.
--

--{.williams}
The variations between the Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] and Canton [[廣州]] dialects consist
in changes in both initials and finals, each having some sounds
which are unknown, or very uncommon in the other. For instance,
the initials _sh_ or _f_ are not found in the Ti(e/)chi(u/), or the initials _b_ [[voiced [b], not voiceless [p]<` `>]],
_lw_, or _mw_ in the Canton; the oblique sound of _(u\)_ in _turn_ is one of
most common finals in the former, and one of the rarest in the latter;
there are no nasal sounds in the Canton, and no words ending with
the finals _i(a/)ng_, _i(a/)k_, both of which are common in the Ti(e/)chi(u/).
These differences are among the most noticeable between the two
leading dialects of this provkice, but the variations as one goes from
Ch(a/)uchau~f(u/) [[潮州府]] westward to Canton city, are numberless, nearly every
village exhibiting some peculiarities in the sounds of a few words.
--

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xi of the original]{#page-xi}[xi] here]]
The standard of pronunciation for the Canton [[廣州]] dialect is a small
duodecimo handbook, sometimes issued separately, but more frequently
combined with a letter-writer and forms of invitation, cards,
funeral eulogies, &c., so that one may help to sell the other. It is
called _Kong-(u/) ch(')ik-tuk, Fan-wan ts(')(u")t-i(u/) h(o\)p ts(a/)p_
[[gong wu cik duk fan wan cyut jiu hap zaap]] 江湖尺牘分韻撮要合集
Letters for Travelers and a Collection of
Important Characters divided by their Tones. The preface of the
work is a mere bookseller's recommendation, and gives no hints upon
the motives or principles which guided the compilers in arranging
the characters. It is as follows:---
--
""""{.williams .quoted}
--
Books giving the sounds of characters, and forms for letter-writers,
are among the most common works in bookstores; but the
largest of them are so cumbrous and bulky as to be troublesome to
refer to, while the smaller kinds are too condensed to be satisfactory
for reference. Consequently, neither of them are well suited for
convenient use. W(u/) Hioh-p(u/) of Y(u/)-sh(a/)n, and Wan K(')i-shih of
W(u/)-k(')(i/) have, however, jointly arranged a collection of words by
their tones, and an assortment of letters for the use of traders in
their travels, which are both comprehensive and brief, giving the
kernel of the matter. The two works assist each other; and as
they are not too large to carry about with one, they are also full and
easy of reference; for as it would be inexpedient to require the purchaser
to get two bulky books at a high price, they are now combined
into a single neat 'sleeve gem,' and arranged on the top and
bottom of the page; so that if one is in doubt respecting the meaning
of a character, he can readily look it up among the classes of
sounds; and if he does not know the exact sound, it will not be
troublesome to gather it from the reading. Thus one part of the
volume will help the other, like a carriage and a boat when one is
traveling by land and water, both having their appropriate uses and
position. Those who are learned will appreciate the propriety of
these remarks. A prefatory note.

Summer of 1782.

[[The English here more closely matches the Chinese text
of a [Summer of 1833 (道光癸巳年仲夏) preface][1833]
than a [Summer of 1782 (乾隆歲次壬寅仲夏) preface][1782].
It is likely that Williams had a third edition whose text was
closer to said 1833 version, yet still dated 1782.]]

--{.williams}
This pocket dictionary is usually bound in four thin volumes, and
sold for twenty-five cents; it contains 7327~characters, and only 175~pages,
or on the average 42~to each page, which plainly shows how
[[[Page~xii of the original]{#page-xii}[xii] here]]
meagre are the definitions. In comparison with the local vocabularies
used at Amoy [[廈門]] and Fuhchau [[福州]], it is very imperfect, and proves the
ignorance of the compilers of what was wanted for a local dictionary,
or leads one to infer that they did not know how to prepare a
good one. There is no table of initials and finals as in those vocabularies,
nor any list of syllables, by combining which one can get
the proper sound of a character; for he who uses it, strangely enough,
is supposed to know already the sound of the character he is in
search of. The unwritten sounds or colloquial words used by the
people of Canton [[廣州]] are nearly all omitted, which is one of the greatest
defects in it, and renders it far less useful to the foreigner who is
learning the dialect than those just spoken of. One reason, probably,
why so little notice is taken of these colloquial words in the Fan Wan [[分韻]]
is the disregard the Cantonese pay to them in their writing, as
no one would degrade his composition by inserting them. This
rejection has had the result of keeping the greater part of them
unwritten, and the compilers of the Fan Wan, knowing no authorized
characters by which to express them, nor having any tabular
system of initials and finals in which to insert them so that the
student could find them, have omitted them. In fact, except in these
two ways, a Chinese actually has no possible means to express
a sound, and the latter mode is so clumsy and unsatisfactory that it
would probably be understood by few natives who use the book.
--

--{.williams}
The adoption of proper characters to denote these unwritten
sounds is a troublesome matter for a native writer, and it is not surprising
that he avoids their use. However, they are occasionally
written, but not all on the same principles. Sometimes a well-known
character of the same tone is selected to express the sound; and its
evidently utter inaptitude in the connection to express any sense is
depended upon to intimate that it is used for a colloquial word.
This expedient is frequently employed by partly educated persons
in letters, when they do not know, or cannot remember the proper
characters. Another device to indicate colloquial words is to prefix
the character _hau_ [[hau]] 口 mouth, or _yan_ [[jan]] 人 a man, at the side of some
well known character of the same sound, but not always of the same
tone. The words _tsoi(6)_ [[zoi6]] a cargo; _(1)k(a/) (2)fo_ [[gaa1 fo2]] 傢伙, furniture;
_(5)mai_ [[mai5]] 咪 do not; _(1)ts(')oi_ [[coi1]] 啋 pshaw! and _(2)t(e/)_ [[de2]] 嗲 remiss, &c., are examples
[[[Page~xiii of the original]{#page-xiii}[xiii] here]]
of this sort, Sometimes, again, a character which comes nearest in
tone is taken to represent the needed sound, and the knowledge of
the reader is expected to inform him that it is employed in a vulgar
sense. The words _(1)n(i/)n_ [[nin1]] 年 milk; _(1)l(a/)n_ [[laan1]] 欄 a bazaar; and _(1)n(a/)i_ [[naai1]] 奶 a lady,
are examples of this practice. Again, characters having
nearly the same meaning as the colloquial word, but of an entirely
different sound, are adopted, so that even if the reader does not know
the vulgar sound he will make no mistake as to the sense. Thus,
the words _(1)hung_ [[hung1]] 烘 to roast, used for _(1)nung_ [[nung1]], to scorch, to scowl;
_[(2)]hung_ [[hung2]] 孔 a hole, used for _(1)lung_ [[lung1]]; are instances of this mode of adaptation.
Lastly, entirely new characters are made for some of them; as
_lat_ [[lat]] 甪 to detach, _p(a/)ng_ [[baang]] 碰 a knock, which of course have no currency
in other parts of China, as neither their sound or meaning
will be known elsewhere. Besides these, there are a few colloquial
words, as _fing_ [[fing]], _kwit_ [[gwit]], _fik_ [[fik]], ap [[ap]], &c., for which no characters can be
found, and which cannot therefore be written at all.
--

--{.williams}
The best course to adopt respecting the colloquial words found
in this dialect, has been a matter of considerable perplexity in the
preparation of this Dictionary. There being so many modes to
express them, it was concluded to follow that plan for each character,
which seemed to be the best understood among the people.
The student must not however place much dependence on many of
the characters employed to denote these unwritten sounds, for they
are not uniformly represented, and other persons would perhaps
choose different characters. The colloquial meanings of a word
are usually distinguished from the more authorized definitions, so
that no trouble will, it is hoped, be found on this score to those who
use the dictionary in other parts of China, where the colloquial is
entirely different.
--

--{.williams}
The characters are classed in the Fan Wan [[分韻]] under thirty-three
finals, whose sounds are represented by standard and well known
characters, as given in the annexed Table, all of them in the four
upper tones, except the two last finals. The characters in the second
half have been selected from the body of the book to illustrate the
lower tones, and to aid the scholar in discriminating the two series.
There, are however actually fifty-three finials in the dialect, if we
include the terminations in the fourth tone.

[[[Page~xvi of the original]{#page-xvi}[xvi] here]]
The variations heard in the pronunciation of words under these
thirty-three finals, though rather perplexing, bear only a small proportion
to the whole number of words in the language. The most
usual discrepancies heard under each order are here given, but it is
impossible, and would be useless, to exhibit every alteration from
what the Fan Wan [[分韻]] represents as the proper sound. On the whole
that manual may be regarded as a fair exhibition of the general pronunciation.
Other modes of spelling the same sounds, adopted by
Dr.~Morrison, Mr.~Devan and Mr.~Bonney, in their vocabularies of
this dialect, and by others who have tried to write them, are given
in parenthesis under each number.
--

++{.williams}
1.
  _S(i/)n_ [[sin]], s(i/)t [[sit]],
  like _seen_, _seat_, _peat_, _mean_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Several of the words commencing with a vowel,
  as _(i/)n_ [[jin]] 言, _(i/)n_ [[jin]] 現, _(i/)t_ [[jit]] 熱, are heard with
  a nasal or aspirate, as _ng(i/)n_, _h(i/)n_, _ng(i/)t_.
  _(Seen, leet.)_

2.
  _Wai_ [[wai]],
  like _buy_, _nigh_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Words under this final occasionally run
  into the longer sound of _(a/)i_ [[aai]] in the 14th~order, especially in those
  like _kwai_ [[gwai]] and _shai_ [[shai]].
  _(Lei, wī, fy.)_

3.
  _K(i/)_ [[gi, now gei]],
  like _me_, _flee_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  A few words beginning with _k_ [[g]], p [[b]] and _f_ [[f]], are
  frequently heard like the [29th]~final [[e]],
  as _k(i/)_ [[gei]] 騎, _p(i/)_ [[bei]] 俾, _f(i/)_ [[fei]] 非, _k(i/)_ [[gei]] 己,
  pronounced _k(e/)_ [[ge]], _p(e/)_ [[be]], _f(e/)_ [[fe]], or _k(e/)_ [[ge]]; but this is the exception. Others
  having no initial, as (i/) [[ji]] 二, (i/) [[ji]] 耳 are often heard _ng(i/)_.
  _(Tee, she, ki.)_

4.
  _Ch(u")_ [[zyu]],
  like _sue_, or the first part of the word _choose_ [[in Received Pronunciation]]. Words in
  this order beginning with _h_ [[h]], _l_ [[l]], _n_ [[n]], and _ts_ [[z]],
  are often heard sliding into
  _hui_ [[heoi]], _lui_ [[leoi]], _nui_ [[neoi]], _tsui_ [[zeoi]],
  like the 22d~order [[eoi]], as 去, 侶, 女, 聚, 序;
  those under the other initials are less frequently mispronounced.
  _(Kuy, sue, n(u/), loÿ, u.)_

5.
  _Sau_ [[sau]],
  like _now_, _cow_, _how_ [[in Received Pronunciation, but shorter]].
  Words in this order like _au_ [[au]] 漚, 嘔,
  having no initial, often seem to a beginner to lengthen the vowels
  into _(a/)u_ [[aau]], like the 18th~order, as also do those like
  _chau_ [[zau]] 肘 _hau_ [[hau]] 后 and _p(')au_ [[pau]], 剖
  but a little practice will discriminate them.
  _(Tsow, shaw, hāw.)_

6.
  _Tung_ [[dung]], _tuk_ [[duk]],
  like the Irishism _wroong_ for _wrung_, and so nearly
  _toong_, _took_, that it is [doubtful] whether this final ought not to be
  written _t(u/)ng_, _t(u/)k_; it must never be sounded like the English words
  _sung_, _hung_, _tongue_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  There are no variants in this final worth noticing.
  _(Soong, yok, tōk.)_

7.
[[[Page~xvii of the original]{#page-xvii}[xvii] here]]
  _Ying_ [[jing]], _yik_ [[jik]],
  like _sing_, _king_, _quick_, _wing_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  So many words under this order change the final into _eng_ and _ek_,
  that a separate list has been made of them in the general Table of Sounds,
  but the proportion is small;
  all the common words are noticed in the body of the Dictionary.
  At Macao [[澳門]] and thereabouts, a large proportion change
  the final into _ang_ [[ang]] and _ak_ [[ak]] of the 15th~order,
  as 兄, 京, 明, 擰, 兵,
  into _hang_ [[hang]], _kang_ [[gang]], _mang_ [[mang]],
  _nang_ [[nang]], _pang_ [[bang]], &c., by which the people from
  Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]] district are recognized at Canton [[廣州]].
  _(Leng, paëng, te-ang, saung.)_

8.
  _Pan_ [[ban]], _pat_ [[bat]],
  like _fun_, _son_, _shun_, _tun_, _won_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never like _man_, _fan_, _hat_, _cat_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Variants in the _yap shing_ [[入聲 yap sing]],
  passing into the long sound _(a/)t_ [[aat]]
  of the 25th~order, are occasionally heard, but a more frequent change
  is into _p(i/)n_, _p(i/)t_, or _pen_, _pet_, which is peculiar to the people of the
  districts of Sinhwui [[新會]] and K(a/)uy(a/)u [[高要]] southwest of Canton [[廣州]].
  _(Pun, kăn, fut, yet, chăt.)_

9.
  _Ch(e/)ung_ [[now zoeng]], _ch(e/)uk_ [[now zoek]],
  like the combined sounds in _say 'em_ [[in Received Pronunciation]]; there
  is no English word with this diphthong [[now not a diphthong]].
  The variations in this final are rare.
  _(Chaong, cheong, lay-ung, yok, naung, tsay-uk.)_

10.
  _Kong_ [[gong]], _kok_ [[gok]],
  like _long_, _song_, _wrong_, _hawk_, _baulk_ [[in Conservative Received Pronunciation]];
  never like _sock_, _lock_ [[in Conservative Received Pronunciation]].
  There is no difficulty in recognizing all words under
  this final, even when as is occasionally the case, they are heard like
  _l(o\)ng_.
  _(Pawng, kawk, l(o/)k, w(o/)ng, hoak, tsoang.)_

11.
  _K(u/)_ [[gu]], _l(o\)_ [[lou]],
  as _coo_, _cuckoo_, _lo_, _hoe_, _flow_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The compilers of the Fan Wan [[分韻]] seem to have been unable to distinguish the characters
  under this final into the two terminations of _(u/)_ [[u]] and _(o\)_ [[ou]],
  and have combined them apparently because in the court dialect most of
  them ended in _(u/)_. Those beginning with _l_ [[l]], _m_ [[m]],
  _sh_ [[merged into s]], and _s_ [[s]] slide
  from _l(u/)_, _m(u/)_, _s(u/)_, _sh(u/)_,
  into _l(o\)_, _m(o\)_, _sh(o\)_, _s(o\)_,
  but under other initials there is
  no trouble in distinguishing them.
  _(Lo, low, ku, foo.)_

12.
  _Chi(u/)_ [[ziu]],
  like _new_, _few_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  both vowels being plainly sounded.
  This final is now and then heard like _(e/)u_ [[eu]],
  as 要 _(e/)u_ for _i(u/)_; 溺 _n(e/)u_ for _ni(u/)_;
  and also sliding into the 4th [[yu]] as 曉 _h(u")_ [[hyu]] for _hi(u/)_ [[hiu]].
  _(Kew, chiu, tee-ue, t(i/)(u/).)_

13.
  _(U")n_ [[jyun]], (u")t [[jyut]],
  like the _u_ in _ruin_, _June_, _jute_, _dilute_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The variations under this final are unimportant, and those are where the vowel is
  changed in a few words to _è_, as 煖 _nèn_ for _n(u")n_ [[nyun]].
  _(Heuet, sh(u/)n, (u/)t, une, sute.)_

14.
[[[Page~xviii of the original]{#page-xviii}[xviii] here]]
  _K(a/)i_ [[gaai]],
  like _aye_, _aisle_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never shortened into _nigh_, _fly_, like the
  2d~final [[ai]], though that frequently is prolonged into this. The Chinese
  discriminate between the diphthongs _ai_ [[ai]] and _(a/)i_ [[aai]] with much accuracy,
  and the student should pay particular attention to them at first, or
  he will constantly confound them.
  _(Pai, nie, tì, k(a/)i, kye.)_

15.
  _Tang_ [[dang]], _tak_ [[dak]],
  like _tongue_, _sung_, _hung_, _muck_, _luck_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never like _hang_, _bang_, _jack_, _sack_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  There are many words placed under this
  final, which from the constant tendency to lengthen the vowel are
  heard like the 32d~final [[aang]],
  as 生 _sh(a/)ng_ [[saang]] for _shang_ [[sang]], 行 _h(a/)ng_ [[haang]] for _hang_ [[hang]], 北 _p(a/)k_ [[baak]] for _pak_ [[bak]], &c.;
  many of these variations are noticed in the body of the work.
  _(Pung, hăng, tuk, măk, hek, sh(a/)ng, y(a/)k.)_

16.
  _Sz'_ [[si]], _tsz'_ [[zi]],
   like no words in the English language, but much
   like a hiss. The people of Canton [[廣州]] itself pronounce these two words
   very clearly, but in the villages around and south of it, they are
   changed into _sh(i/)_, _s(u")_, _sz(u")_, _sch(i/)_, _ts(u")_, _ts(i/)_, _ch(')(i/)_,
   so that in many cases it is hard to recognize them.
   _(Sze, sz, sse, ss', tse.)_

17.
  _Kam_ [[gam]], _kap_ [[gap]],
  like _hum_, _some_, _come_, _sup_, _tup_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  never like _ham_, _rap_, nor _came_, _lame_, _nape_, _rape_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  A few words properly referred to this final lengthen the vowel into
  _k(a/)m_ [[gaam]], _k(a/)p_ [[gaap]], like the 24th, and others
  also are changed into short _e_, as _kem_, _nem_.
  _(Yum, shup, lăm[,] shăp.)_

18.
  _K(a/)u_ [[gaau]],
  like _how_ [[in Received Pronunciation]] very much prolonged; the difference between
  this, and the 5th~final [[au]] is merely in the longer sound of the _(a/)_ [[aa]].
  There are no variations in pronunciation worth noticing in this final.
  _(Pow, kaou, chaow.)_

19.
  _Tsoi_ [[zoi]],
  like _boy_, _noise_, _loiter_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The _oi_ in some of the words referred to [in] this final,
  inclines to _ui_ [[eoi]] of the 22d, as 來 內 台 _lui_, _nui_, _t[(')]ui_,
  for _loi_, _noi_, _t[(')]oi_, but a little care will easily discriminate
  them; most of the words are uniformly sounded.
  _(Toy, suy.)_

20.
  _K(i/)m_ [[gim]], _k(i/)p_ [[gip]],
  like _cream_, _seem_, _team_, _sheep_, _reap_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The words under this final are very uniform, and there is no particular
  character worth noticing as a variant.
  _(Keem, leep.)_

21.
  _Tsun_ [[now zeon]], _tsut_ [[now zeot]],
  like the _u_ in _put_, _nuisance_, the sound lying
  between the vowel sounds in _fun_ and _fool_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  in the 8th [[an]] and 27th [[un]] orders;
  the 8th, 21st and 27th finals _pan_ [[ban]], _tsun_ [[zeon]], _k(u/)n_ [[gun]],
  are kept very distinct by the Chinese, and must not be confounded. It is not
  easy to distinguish the _u_ in this order
  from the _u_ in _tung_, _tuk_, as
  some have endeavored to do, for if the word _tsun_ be slowly prolonged
  [[[Page~xix of the original]{#page-xix}[xix] before 'ed']] into _tsung_,
  it will be seen the difference is in the quantity rather
  than in the quality of the vowel.
  _(Tsun, soot.)_

22.
  _Sui_ [[now seoi]],
  a combination of _u_ in the preceding order with _i_; there is
  no similar sound in English. Words under the 4th~final [[yu]]
  commencing with _s_ [[s]], _l_ [[l]] or _n_ [[n]],
  easily run into this, and some of those placed here,
  as _tsui_ [[zeoi]], _yui_ [[jeoi]], _tui_ [[deoi]],
  also run into the 28th~order [[ui]]. The Chinese, who are
  not fettered or guided by any alphabetic sounds, often discriminate
  these nearly homophonous words better than we do.
  _(Suy, mooy, soÿ, shoo-e.)_

23.
  _Fo_ [[fo]],
  like _law_, _saw_, _taw_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  not _lo_, _no_, _two_ [[in Received Pronunciation]];
  the _o_ as in _long_, _sawn_ [[in Conservative Received Pronunciation]],
  as in the 10th [[ong]] and 30th [[on]] orders.
  This final undergoes no changes, that are worth noticing.
  _(Waw, h(o/), l(a/)w, hō.)_

24.
  _K(a/)m_ [[gaam]], _k(a/)p_ [[gaap]],
  like _calm_, _psalm_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  not like _ham_, _jamb_, _rap_, _map_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  The characters under this final are comparatively few, and the
  changes in their pronunciation very slight.
  _(Lahm, kam, tarm, chaap, kap.)_

25.
  _F(a/)n_ [[faan]], _f(a/)t_ [[faat]],
  like _Jahn_, _father_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  not like _fan_, _fat_, _man_, _mat_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  In the district of Shunteh [[順德]], some characters in this order take a
  singular change to _èn_, as 間 _hèn_ (like _mane_), 板 _pèn_, 鹹 _kèn_ (like _cane_),
  and so of others.
  _(Wan, pann, fat.)_

26.
  _K(a/)_ [[gaa]],
  like _ma_, _pa_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  a syllable that can hardly be mispronounced;
  there are no variations in the characters found under it.
  _(Ka, fah, taa.)_

27.
  _K(u/)n_ [[gun]], _k(u/)t_ [[gut]],
  like _loon_, _coot_, _moot_, _noon_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
   presents no changes in
   the sounds of the few characters found under it worth noticing.
   _(Poon, foot.)_

28.
  _F(u/)i_ [[fui]] is a well defined diphthong,
  like _buoy_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  broader than _sui_ [[seoi]] in the 22d~order,
  and having only one initial in common with that;
  the consonant has much influence on the quantity of the vowel.
  _(Tsoÿ, luÿ, kooy, nui, oo-e.)_

29.
  _Ch(e/)_ [[now ze]],
  like _may_, _lay_, _they_, _yea_ [[in Received Pronunciation]];
  it has few aberrations,
  and most of those are mispronunciations from the 3d~order [[ei]],
  under a few initial
  _(Yay, ya, se-ay.)_

30.
  _Kon_ [[gon]], _kot_ [[got]],
  like _lawn_, _brawn_, _fought_, _sought_ [[in Received Pronunciation]];
  there are very few characters under final, and in the mouths of many persons
  some of them, as _on_ [[on]] and _ngon_ [[ngon]]
  are heard like _ong_ [[ong]] and _ngong_ [[ngong]].
  _(Hoan, kon, (o/)n, kōt.)_

31.
[[[Page~xx of the original]{#page-xx}[xx] here]]
  _K(o\)m_ [[now gam]], _k(o\)p_ [[now gap]],
  like _home_, _comb_, _hope_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  not like _some_, _come_, _sup_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  or _tom_, _hop_ [[in Received Pronunciation]];
  there is a peculiar _ora rotunda_ observable in the pronunciation
  of the few words referred to this order.
  _(K(u/)m, kup, kōm, h(o/)m, h(a/)p, hōp, h(o/)p.)_

32.
  _P(')(a/)ng_ [[paang]], _p(a/)k_ [[baak]],
  sounded with a broad _a_,
  and not like _bang_, _hang_, _crack_ [[in Received Pronunciation]].
  Many words under the 15th~final [[ang]] are so uniformly sounded
  like this that they should properly have been placed under it; there
  is a constant tendency of the short vowels to lengthen into the broader
  ones.
  _(H(a/)k, lang, chak.)_

33.
  _'Ng_ [[ng]], _'M_ [[m]],
  are sounds heard in all languages, in rapid conversation,
  but such as are seldom written; _hng_ and _hm_ is perhaps a
  better form of writing them than that here adopted.
  _(Im, 'm, ing, ng.)_

###{#initials .williams} List of the Initials.


--{.williams}
No list of initials is given in the Fan Wan [[分韻]]; there are twenty-three
in all, which are here represented by the following characters.
The first one is a mute, and used when the final only is pronounced,
having no consonant before it.
--
++{.williams}
1. Au [[au]] 毆
2. Chi [[merged into zi]] 之
3. Ch'ut [[merged into ceot]] 出
4. Fung [[fung]] 風
5. Hoi [[hoi]] 開
6. K(i/)n [[gin]] 見
7. K(')ing [[king]] 傾
8. Kwai [[gwai]] 鬼
9. Kw(')(a/) [[kwa]] 誇
10. Lam [[lam]] 林
11. M(a/) [[maa]] 馬
12. N(a/)m [[naam]] 南
13. Ng(a/) [[ngaa]] 牙
14. P(a/) [[baa]] 把
15. P(')o [[po]] 婆
16. S(a/)m [[saam]] 三
17. Shing [[merged into sing]] 聖
18. T(a/) [[daa]] 打
19. T(')oi [[toi]] 台
20. Tsing [[zing]] 精
21. Ts(')ai [[cai]] [齊]
22. W(a/) [[waa]] 華
23. Ying [[jing]] 英
++
--{.williams}
The diversities in the initials are so much fewer than those in the
finals, that they are soon described, though for their number they
give more trouble, perhaps, than the others.
--
===={.williams}
- 1. All words having no initial consonant, are very liable to have
  a nasal _ng_ [[ng]] or an _h_ [[h]] prefixed to them, or to have the vowel altered.
  The people in Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]], Macao [[澳門]], and Sin-ng(a/)n [[新安]], change many words
  in this way, so that if one does not see the character, he will look
  for it under _h_ or _ng_.

- 2,~20. The initials _ch_ and _ts_ are constantly confounded, and some
  persons are absolutely unable to detect the difference, more frequently
  calling the words under _ts_ as _ch_, than contrariwise.
  All characters
  [[[Page~xxi of the original]{#page-xxi}[xxi] before 'racters']]
  with the sounds _tsz'_ and _ts(')z'_ are liable to be heard _ch(i/)_ and
  _ch(')(i/)_, with a stronger breathing than those properly read _ch(i/)_ and
  _ch(')(i/)_.

  <ins class="modern">
  --
  (Indeed modern Cantonese has merged the pairs:
  --
  =={.modern}
  - _ch_~[tɕ] and _ts_~[ts] (represented in Jyutping as z);
  - _ch(')_~[tɕʰ] and _ts(')_~[tsʰ] (represented in Jyutping as c); and
  - _sh_~[ɕ] and _s_~[s] (represented in Jyutping as s).
  ==
  --
  But it is not quite as simple as that.
  In two decades of personal experience,
  I have perceived a *tendency* for speakers to
  consistently favour specific initials depending on the vowel afterward:
  --
  ||||{.wide}
  ''
    |^
      //
        ; Vowel afterwards
        ;{c=3} Favoured post-merger initials
      //
        , [aː] aa
        ,{r=5} _ts_ [ts]
        ,{r=5} _ts(')_ [tsʰ]
        ,{r=10} _s_ [s]
      //
        , [ɐ] a
      //
        , [ɛː] e
      //
        , [e] i
      //
        , [iː] i
      //
        , [ɔː] o
        ,{r=6} _ch_ [tɕ]
        ,{r=6} _ch(')_ [tɕʰ]
      //
        , [o] o
      //
        , [uː] u
      //
        , [œ] oe
      //
        , [ɵ] eo
      //
        , [yː] yu
        , _sh_ [ɕ]
  ''
  ||||
  --
  For example, the modern speaker will prefer:
  --
  ==
  - _sek_ [sɛːk̚] over _shek_ [ɕɛːk̚] for 石;
  - _s(a/)ng ch(')oi_ [saːŋ tɕʰɔːy] over
    _sh(a/)ng ts(')oi_ [ɕaːŋ tsʰɔːy] for 生菜.
  ==
  --
  This subtlety is not captured by any modern romanisation scheme
  that collapses the merged pairs.
  --
  --
  Here endeth the rant.)
  --
  </ins>

- 4. The people along the coast and south of Canton [[廣州]] often alter the
  initial _f_ [[f]] into _h_ [[h]] or _w_ [[w]] in some words, and retain it in others; it
  changes sooner before _(a/)_ [[aa]] or _a_ [[a]],
  than before _(i/)_ [[long i]] or _u_ [[u]].

- 10,~11. The two initials _l_ [[l]] and _m_ [[m]] are frequently so interchanged in
  the mouths of some people, that one is much puzzled to distinguish
  them, and even _n_ is altered too;
    as _l(a/)m_ [[laam]] 南 for _n(a/)m_ [[naam]];
    _m(a/)n_ [[maan]] 欄 for _l(a/)n_ [[laan]];
    _l(o\)_ [[lou]] 奴 for _n(o\)_ [[nou]];
    &c.
  The number of such words is not very
  great, and while the few who speak thus cannot discriminate the
  inital consonant before some vowels, they never interchange them
  before others.

- 16,~17. The initial _sh_ is called _s_ along the coast;
  in the districts of Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]], Sinning [[新寧]] and Sinngan [[新安]],
  this obtains to a very great extent;
  _shui_ 水, _sh(u")_ 書, _shuk_ 熟, _sh(a/)ng shing_ 省城, &c. &c.,
  being heard _sui_, _s(u")_, and _s(a/)ng sing_, as in the Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] and Amoy [[廈門]]
  dialects. The initial _sh_ is a complete shibboleth to the people of
  those districts. West of Canton [[廣州]], many are found who change _sz'_ [[si]]
  into _s(u")_ [[syu]], and a large part of the words beginning with _s_ are changed
  into _sh_ just the opposite of the usage at Macao [[澳門]].
  [[See rant at 2,~20. for more on _sh_ versus _s_.]]
====
--{.williams}
These five classes of changes are the most frequent, and with
those in the finals may perhaps discourage the beginner whether he
be able to learn a speech which varies so much in its pronunciation.
The proportion the variants bear to the whole body of characters
is not so great, however, as he might conclude, and when once
ascertained it will not be difficult to follow them; besides which, no
individual will ever be found who has them all.

###{#orthography .williams} System of Orthography Used in this Dictionary.

--{.williams}
The system of writing the sounds of the Chinese characters
adopted in this Dictionary is nearly like that proposed by Sir W.~Jones,
and already used to some extent in China. It is exhibited
in the following table:---
--

--{.williams}
The above comprise all the vowels, diphthongs and consonants,
found in the Canton [[廣州]] dialect. In addition the Court Dialect contains
a few more, and as the pronunciation of each character in the
[[[Page~xxiii of the original]{#page-xxiii}[xxiii] here]]
Fan Wan [[分韻]] is given in that dialect under it, they are here added.
For the sounds given to the characters in this dialect, the dictionaries
of De~Guignes, Morrison, Gonçalves, and Medhurst, nearly
agree throughout; and though what is termed the _kw(a/)n hw(a/)_ [[官話]] differs
as much as any of the local dialects, when it is heard in different
parts of the country, still there is a general resemblance. This
system is more strictly that which is known among the Chinese as
the _N(a/)n hw(a/)_ [[南華]] or Southern dialect, in contradistinction to the _Peh hw(a/)_ [[北華]]
or Northern dialect, the cities of N(a/)nking [[南京]] and Peking [[北京]] respectively
being regarded as the standards of authority of the two. The
additional finals and initials found in the Court Dialect alone are the
following:---
--
=={.williams}
- _ei_, nearly as in _weigh_ [[in Received Pronunciation]],
  but very open, both vowels being heard.
- _i(a/)_, as in _yard_ [[in Received Pronunciation]], _piastre_, both vowels plainly heard.
- _i(a/)h_, like the last, [but] ending abruptly.
- _i(a/)i_, a triphthong, each letter of which is heard.
- _i(a/)ng_, like _i(a/)h_, except the final _ng_; both are pronounced broad.
- _i(a/)u_, _i(e/)_, _ieh_, _ien_, _ih_, _in_, _ioh_, _iueh_, _iuen_, _iuh_, _iun_, and _iung_, are all
  to be sounded distinctly, the _i_ to be plainly enunciated before the other letters.
- _oh_, is an abrupt ending, like _knock_ [[in Received Pronunciation]], though not so decided.
- _ueh_, _uen_, and _uh_, are all to be sounded distinctly. All words ending
  in~_h_, are in the _jih shing_ [[入聲]], but it is generally so soft as to lead
  many to say that this tone does not occur in the court dialect.
==

--{.williams}
By combining all the fifty-three finals with all the twenty-three
initials, there would be 1229 [[I get 53~×~23 = 1219]] sounds in the dialect which could be
represented by Roman letters; there are however only 707 different
syllables given in this Dictionary, many possible combinations, as
_kw(o\)m_ [[gwam]], _t(a/)ng_ [[daang]], _l(u/)t_ [[lut]], _p(u")t_ [[byut]],
_kw(e/)ung_ [[gwoeng]], _f(a/)m_ [[faam]], _foi_ [[foi]], _lon_ [[lon]],
_shot_ [[sot]], _s(u/)n_ [[sun]], _[wi(u/)]_, &c.,
not occuring in the dialect. The table of all the sounds here given
will show the paucity of different vocables, though it does not
probably include *all* the variations heard among the people, which
however most frequently run into other sounds occurring in the table,
and do often exhibit new sounds. The list of finals in the first
column is arranged according to the table from the Fan Wan [[分韻]] on
[page~xiv](#page-xiv), and not alphabetically.
--

--{.williams}
[["Table of Sounds in the Canton Dialect"
covers [Page~xxiv of the original]{#page-xxiv}[xxiv]
and [Page~xxv of the original]{#page-xxv}[xxv];
omitted here due to its size.]]
--

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xxvi of the original]{#page-xxvi}[xxvi] here]]
The final _h(u\)_ [[hoe]], _k(u\)_ [[goe]], _l(u\)_ [[loe]] &c.,
in the last line but one in this Table,
is not found in the Fan Wan [[分韻]] at all; the compilers appear to have
thought it unnecessary to add a whole order and another final for
the sake of one character, _h(u\)_ [[hoe]] 靴 a boot, the only one in the dialect
not vulgar or colloquial.
--

--{.williams}
It will prove serviceable for the student to make out a table of
characters to correspond to this table of sounds, and read them
across and down with a native, so as to notice the effect made on
a final by changing the initial, and the alterations produced on an
initial under many finals. Reading over such a table a dozen times
with as many educated natives, will give as distinct an idea of the
changes which characters undergo in their sounds in the speech of
different persons, as can be obtained.
--

--{.williams}
There have been attempts to follow up these changes in writing
this dialect in Roman letters, but in all cases it is better to adhere
to the classified arrangement given in the Fan Wan [[分韻]], and remember
the exceptions as being such. In the vocabularies and phrase-books
of Dr.~Morrison, Mr.~Devan and Mr.~Bonney, no attention has been
paid to the classes of finals as given in the Fan Wan, or to the tones
or aspirates, and the errors in writing the words are numerous, even
according to their own modes of spelling.
--

--{.williams}
The system of writing Chinese sounds here followed, has been
adopted, with some slight variations, in writing other dialects of
the language; but it would be a great advantage to all[ ]students in it
if all the modes of spelling the dialects could be harmonized. It is
not supposed, by this remark, that this one is the best which could
be proposed, for some features of it could be modified to advantage,
but it certainly is more accurate for the student's use than to follow
the common English alphabet, with all its strange anomalies. The
various modes of writing each sound, as quoted after the remarks on
pp.~[xvi](#page-xvi)....[xix](#page-xix), show how much difficulty has been felt by those who
have tried to write them according to the English alphabet.
--

--{.williams}
Mr.~Goddard, in his Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] Vocabulary, uses _(a/)_, _a_ and _(u\)_ as in this
table, but _e_, _i_, _i_, _(o/)_, and _u_, are substituted by him
for the _(e/)_, _(i/)_, _(o\)_, _o_, and _(u/)_,
in this table. He did not perceive that he was confusing his
own pronunciation by representing the _(i/)_ in _machine_ and in _pin_ by
the same letter; as he was by blending the _e_ in _they_ and _men_. At
[[[Page~xxvii of the original]{#page-xxvii}[xxvii] here]]
Amoy [[廈門]], unaccented vowels have been used, and the tones marked
by accents over the letters, which is likely still more to confuse
those who may try to read the sounds in that dialect, as a single
quotation will show.

At Fuhchau [[福州]], the dialect is written very nearly like the Amoy,

--{.williams}
The differences between all these modes of writing Chinese sounds
are really not very great, for in none of them has the English alphabet
been followed, and it would not be very difficult to reconcile
them to one standard, an object which appears still more desirable
when the plan of Romanizing them for the use of unlearned natives
is taken into the account. Perhaps it would, however, be best to
discard them all, and adopt Lepsius' universal alphabet, with which
he proposes to harmonize the mode of writing all languages.

##{#tones .williams} 2. The Tones.

--{.williams}
The _shing_ [[sing]] 聲 or tones form one of the most difficult and peculiar
features of the Chinese spoken language, but they can neither be
fully or easily described satisfactorily, for the reason that no European
language has them. Strictly speaking, they are neither tones,
modulations, accents, nor emphasis, as those words are usually
applied in western languages; they probably more nearly resemble
the sound of notes in music. The note _G_ on a violin, an organ, or
a bagpipe, strikes the ear very differently, like the voices of a child
or man; the note is alike on the gamut, and it chords on all those
instruments; but let _G_~sharp he struck on one of them, and we feel
the discord, it is not the note at all. So in respect to Chinese
_shing_; if the right _shing_ be not spoken, the right word is not spoken,
[[[Page~xxviii of the original]{#page-xxviii}[xxviii] here]]
it is some other word. For instance, if a person says _k(u/)(3)_ [[gu3]] instead
of _(1)k(u/)_ [[gu1]] 孤 an orphan, he does not say the word for _orphan_ at all;
he says that for 故 _old_, or 固 _firm_, or 顧 _to hire_, or some other
word equally remote in meaning. It is as if on the violin the player
strikes _G_~sharp, instead of _G_~natural; though he makes a note
he makes no chord with the organ or bagpipe sounding _G_~natural; as
it were, he speaks the wrong tone, and does not express his meaning.
It may not be indeed the case in Chinese, that the hearer will *always*
misunderstand the speaker even if the tones are pronounced wrong,
for there are additional clues to the meaning, but the chances are
against it.
