This Dictionary contains only a portion of all the characters in the
Chinese language, but they are those in general use, and such as
occur most frequently in books and ordinary writings. The total
number of characters in Kánghí's Dictionary <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">康熙字典</span>)</ins> is set down at about
44,400, of which nearly 15,000 are either duplicate or obsolete forms,
while of the remaining 30,000, fully two-thirds are names of places
or persons, or old, unusual words seldom met with in the course of
one's reading. All these characters are included in the Dictionaries
of both Drs. Morrison and Medhurst, but in those of De Guignes,
Gonçalves, and Callery, a selection of the common characters has
been made, to the number of from 11,000 to 13,000 in each work.
That this last number includes all that are really necessary is partly
proved by the usefulness of the work of Gonçalves, and especially
that of De Guignes, which has been in the hands of students
more than two score years, and by Klaproth's Appendix to it,
which, after years of study, he added only a few hundred characters
to the main work. It is evident, therefore, that when we have
dictionaries like those of Morrison and Medhurst, containing the
meanings and forms of all the characters, there is less need of
repeating the same in other works; as the unusual ones are so rarely
met with, and the student will always have Kánghí's Dictionary <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">康熙字典</span>)</ins> at
hand if no other. There is, indeed, always a chance of meeting
with an unusual character, as the name of a person or place, in
any book one may take up; and for these the fullest dictionary is
the most satisfactory.

This work contains 7850 characters, including a few common
abbreviations and duplicate forms. Its plan is stated on page xxxiii
of the Introduction, and it is hoped that it will be found to work
well in practice. How the work itself has been performed, and
whether it is any advance on what has been already done, will be
decided by those who use it. With the books already published,
<ins class="modern">(<a href="https://archive.org/details/tonicdictionaryo00will/page/n9/mode/1up">Page vi</a> here)</ins>
it will form a tolerably complete apparatus for learning the Canton
dialect, though not all that is wanted. These works are five, <i>viz.</i>—

<ul class="williams">

Vocabulary of the Canton Dialect, 3 Parts. By R. Morrison. 1827.

The first two are out of print; the next two contain also some
directions and exercises for learning the general language, the sounds
alone being in this dialect.

Chinese lexicographers have done much to elucidate their own
language, and we may regard the common dictionary of [Kánghí],
called ''Kánghí Tsz' Tien'' <span lang="zh-Hant">康熙字典</span>, which has been in use
throughout the empire for nearly 150 years, as one of the best
dictionaries ever published by Asiatics. The list of works of this
class given by Callery proves the vast labor spent in this direction
by Chinese scholars through a long series of generations. Yet, in
respect to satisfying the requirements of a foreign student, no
Chinese dictionary will be found sufficient. The uses of a character
as a verb, a noun, a particle, or an adjective, are usually not
given at all, chiefly because Chinese grammarians do not habitually
make these distinctions; and the definitions are made by quoting
other words as synonyms, and not by explaining the usages of the
one under examination. For instance, take the word <i>꜃lai</i> <ins class="modern">(lai5)</ins> <span lang="zh-Hant">禮</span>, an important
one in Chinese literature. Kánghí <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">康熙</span>)</ins> says it means, "To follow
(or tread in) <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">履也</span>)</ins>; whatever men do in serving the gods to obtain
happiness <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">所以事神致福也</span>)</ins>; to put in form <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">體也</span>)</ins>, to obtain (or show) the form of an act <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">得其事體也</span>)</ins>. A
surname <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">又姓</span>)</ins>." None of the metaphorical and derivative senses are
given, which, as will be seen by reference to the character, have
now become important and common. These generally have yet to
be carefully collected from good authors, and their application
illustrated.
</p>
<p class="williams">
The difficulties in making a complete Anglo–Chinese lexicon result from three causes. <i>First</i>, the vast extent of the literature, running
<ins class="modern">(<a href="https://archive.org/details/tonicdictionaryo00will/page/n10/mode/1up">Page vii</a> here)</ins>
through many ages, naturally involve changes in the use of words
by so many authors of different degrees of intellect, genius, and
learning. The same word has been used by these authors to
denote different shades of meaning, and it is a great labor to trace
out these meanings. <i>Second</i>, it is not easy to find exact equivalents
for Chinese words in European languages. Even in concrete things,
as <span lang="zh-Hant">書</span>, <span lang="zh-Hant">筆</span>, <span lang="zh-Hant">鞋</span>, <span lang="zh-Hant">船</span>, the differences are numerous, and require
explanation before calling them a <i>book</i>, a <i>pencil</i>, a <i>shoe</i>, or a <i>ship</i>;
how much more unlike must they be when mental, religious, or
poetical terms are to be explained by words from languages so dissimilar
as English and Chinese. The Chinese, like other nations,
necessarily describe their mental and abstract thoughts by words
derived from sensible objects, and the scope and application of such
words are familiar to them, but not so to the foreigner, whose mind
has been trained differently. What adds to this difficulty is the
vague and erroneous ideas the Chinese have respecting many things,
which embarrasses one who tries to define them by the more precise
words of his own language. <i>Third</i>, the years of study which are
required in a wearisome climate before a foreigner is even partially
fitted for making a dictionary, has also proved a serious hindrance
to the preparation of a complete lexicon in the Chinese language.
No one has yet sat down to the work unfettered by other engagements,
and willing to spend his life in making a full dictionary of
this language.

This volume will assist in learning to speak the Canton dialect,
and as the meanings of the characters are the same, any one can
use it in translating. It is as suitable for learning the Court dialect
as Morrison's is for learning the Canton or Tiéchiú <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">潮州</span>)</ins> dialects; and
those who are unable to procure the larger works, may find aid in
it to enable them to read ChinevSe books. It has been prepared
with care, by consulting previous works and a large collection of
phrases written out by competent natives, and the meanings synthetically
made up from the examples in which they occur. The
space did not permit a large portion of these phrases to be explained
as fully as would have been desirable to understand their application.
Technical uses of words in law, medicine, astrology, poetry, and
such science as the Chinese possess, have not been very extensively
<ins class="modern">(<a href="https://archive.org/details/tonicdictionaryo00will/page/n11/mode/1up">Page viii</a> here)</ins>
collected hitherto; this work probably contains a few more than
any other, and perhaps expressed a little more definitely. It is no
assistance to a foreigner to know that <i>꜃lí</i> <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">鯉</span>; lei5)</ins> is the name of a fish, or
<i>꜀ying</i> <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">鷹</span>; jing1)</ins> the name of a bird, or <i>꜁hang</i> <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">恆</span>; hang4)</ins> the name of a mountain,
though these words may convey to a Chinese as definite an idea as the words
<i>carp</i>, <i>eagle</i>, or <i>Alps</i>, do to an Englishman. Yet in most cases
only an approximation can yet be made to defining hundreds of such
words.
