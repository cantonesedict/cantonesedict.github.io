This Dictionary contains only a portion of all the characters in the
Chinese language, but they are those in general use, and such as
occur most frequently in books and ordinary writings. The total
number of characters in K(a/)ngh(i/)'s Dictionary [[康熙字典]] is set down at about
44,400, of which nearly 15,000 are either duplicate or obsolete forms,
while of the remaining 30,000, fully two-thirds are names of places
or persons, or old, unusual words seldom met with in the course of
one's reading. All these characters are included in the Dictionaries
of both Drs.~Morrison and~Medhurst, but in those of De~Guignes,
Gonçalves, and Callery, a selection of the common characters has
been made, to the number of from 11,000 to 13,000 in each work.
That this last number includes all that are really necessary is partly
proved by the usefulness of the work of Gonçalves, and especially
that of De~Guignes, which has been in the hands of students
more than two score years, and by Klaproth's Appendix to it,
which, after years of study, he added only a few hundred characters
to the main work. It is evident, therefore, that when we have
dictionaries like those of Morrison and Medhurst, containing the
meanings and forms of all the characters, there is less need of
repeating the same in other works; as the unusual ones are so rarely
met with, and the student will always have K(a/)ngh(i/)'s Dictionary [[康熙字典]] at
hand if no other. There is, indeed, always a chance of meeting
with an unusual character, as the name of a person or place, in
any book one may take up; and for these the fullest dictionary is
the most satisfactory.

This work contains 7850 characters, including a few common
abbreviations and duplicate forms. Its plan is stated on page~xxxiii
of the Introduction, and it is hoped that it will be found to work
well in practice. How the work itself has been performed, and
whether it is any advance on what has been already done, will be
decided by those who use it. With the books already published,
[[[Page~vi][vi] here]]
it will form a tolerably complete apparatus for learning the Canton
dialect, though not all that is wanted. These works are five, _viz._---

The first two are out of print; the next two contain also some
directions and exercises for learning the general language, the sounds
alone being in this dialect.
