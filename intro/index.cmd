##{#canton .williams} 1. The Canton Dialect.

--{.williams}
The dialect of the Chinese language spoken most accurately in
the city of Canton [[廣州]], and hence usually called the Canton Dialect, is
understood throughout the districts in the western half of the province
of Kw(a/)ngtung [[廣東]], with only unimportant exceptions. Though the
variations from the speech of the citizens of Canton itself and from
each other, heard in these districts are numerous, still the general
characteristics of the dialect in its idiom and pronunciation, are
preserved, and the people find little difficulty in talking with each
other. The people from the district of Sinhwui 新會 lying south-\
westerly from Canton, exhibit the most remarkable peculiarities
in pronunciation, and it is a puzzle to the scholars in the city
how they should have originated. The Canton dialect differs so
much from that spoken at the extreme east of the province, in
the department of Ch(a/)uchau 潮州, and in most parts of the adjoining
prefectures of Ki(a/)ying~chau [[嘉應州]] and Hwaichau~f(u/) [[惠州府]], that their
inhabitants are not intelligible to citizens of the capital. This
dialect, usually called the Ti(e/)chi(u/) from the local sound of 潮州,
and the Canton, constitute the speech of probably six sevenths of
the nineteen millions reckoned as the population of the whole province;
still this estimate is based on no very reliable data, owing to
the difficulty of actual examination. The patois known as the _h(a/)k-k(a/)_ [[客家]]
approaches very near to the Canton, and people from Kw(a/)ngs(i/) [[廣西]]
are easily understood in this city. Both the Canton and Ti(e/)chi(u/)
dialects differ so materially in idiom and pronunciation from the
general language of China, called the _kw(a/)n hw(a/)_ 官話 court or
mandarin dialect, that those speaking only the latter do not understand
them; and when they come to Canton as officers, are always
obliged to employ interpreters to explain to them the depositions
made in their courts by the common people.

[[[Page~x of the original]{#page-x}<n17> here]]
The variations between the court and Canton [[廣州]] dialects, in the
pronunciation of the great body of characters, are so regular as to
enable one to guess with a tolerable degree of certainty, what their
sounds are in the other, the more so because the variations are
chiefly in the finals, and not so numerous in the initials, as is the
case in some of the Fuhkien [[福建]] patois. The unusual changes nearly
all occur in characters having the fourth tone [[入聲 of Middle Chinese, not of modern Mandarin]]. The most common
changes in the finals are here given:---

The frequency of the abrupt consonontal terminations _k_, _p_, and _t_,
in the Canton [[廣州]] dialect, immediately strike a northerner from Ki(a/)ngs(u/) [[江蘇]],
who has been used to hear all terminations soft and flowing; but
the people from those provinces are said to learn this dialect sooner
than those from Amoy [[廈門]] and Fuhchau [[福州]], whose nasal sounds and
greater changes in the initials, are more difficult to accord with it.
Unlike what exists in the province of Fuhkien, here there is not so
great a difference between the language as spoken and read, as to
require almost the acquisition of a double medium.
--

--{.williams}
The variations between the Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] and Canton [[廣州]] dialects consist
in changes in both initials and finals, each having some sounds
which are unknown, or very uncommon in the other. For instance,
the initials _sh_ or _f_ are not found in the Ti(e/)chi(u/), or the initials _b_ [[voiced [b], not voiceless [p]^]],
_lw_, or _mw_ in the Canton; the oblique sound of _(u\)_ in _turn_ is one of
most common finals in the former, and one of the rarest in the latter;
there are no nasal sounds in the Canton, and no words ending with
the finals _i(a/)ng_, _i(a/)k_, both of which are common in the Ti(e/)chi(u/).
These differences are among the most noticeable between the two
leading dialects of this province, but the variations as one goes from
Ch(a/)uchau~f(u/) [[潮州府]] westward to Canton city, are numberless, nearly every
village exhibiting some peculiarities in the sounds of a few words.

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xi of the original]{#page-xi}<n18> here]]
The standard of pronunciation for the Canton [[廣州]] dialect is a small
duodecimo handbook, sometimes issued separately, but more frequently
combined with a letter-writer and forms of invitation, cards,
funeral eulogies, &c., so that one may help to sell the other. It is
called _Kong-(u/) ch(')ik-tuk, Fan-wan ts(')(u:)t-i(u/) h(o\)p ts(a/)p_
[[gong wu cik duk fan wan cyut jiu hap zaap]] 江湖尺牘分韻撮要合集
Letters for Travelers and a Collection of
Important Characters divided by their Tones. The preface of the
work is a mere bookseller's recommendation, and gives no hints upon
the motives or principles which guided the compilers in arranging
the characters. It is as follows:---
--
""""{.williams .quoted}
--
Books giving the sounds of characters, and forms for letter-writers,
are among the most common works in bookstores; but the
largest of them are so cumbrous and bulky as to be troublesome to
refer to, while the smaller kinds are too condensed to be satisfactory
for reference. Consequently, neither of them are well suited for
convenient use. W(u/) Hioh-p(u/) of Y(u/)-sh(a/)n, and Wan K(')i-shih of
W(u/)-k(')(i/) have, however, jointly arranged a collection of words by
their tones, and an assortment of letters for the use of traders in
their travels, which are both comprehensive and brief, giving the
kernel of the matter. The two works assist each other; and as
they are not too large to carry about with one, they are also full and
easy of reference; for as it would be inexpedient to require the purchaser
to get two bulky books at a high price, they are now combined
into a single neat 'sleeve gem,' and arranged on the top and
bottom of the page; so that if one is in doubt respecting the meaning
of a character, he can readily look it up among the classes of
sounds; and if he does not know the exact sound, it will not be
troublesome to gather it from the reading. Thus one part of the
volume will help the other, like a carriage and a boat when one is
traveling by land and water, both having their appropriate uses and
position. Those who are learned will appreciate the propriety of
these remarks. A prefatory note.

Summer of 1782.

[[The English here more closely matches the Chinese text
of a [Summer of 1833 (道光癸巳年仲夏) preface][1833]
than a [Summer of 1782 (乾隆歲次壬寅仲夏) preface][1782].
It is likely that Williams had a third edition whose text was
closer to said 1833 version, yet still dated 1782.]]

This pocket dictionary is usually bound in four thin volumes, and
sold for twenty-five cents; it contains 7327~characters, and only 175~pages,
or on the average 42~to each page, which plainly shows how
[[[Page~xii of the original]{#page-xii}<n19> here]]
meagre are the definitions. In comparison with the local vocabularies
used at Amoy [[廈門]] and Fuhchau [[福州]], it is very imperfect, and proves the
ignorance of the compilers of what was wanted for a local dictionary,
or leads one to infer that they did not know how to prepare a
good one. There is no table of initials and finals as in those vocabularies,
nor any list of syllables, by combining which one can get
the proper sound of a character; for he who uses it, strangely enough,
is supposed to know already the sound of the character he is in
search of. The unwritten sounds or colloquial words used by the
people of Canton [[廣州]] are nearly all omitted, which is one of the greatest
defects in it, and renders it far less useful to the foreigner who is
learning the dialect than those just spoken of. One reason, probably,
why so little notice is taken of these colloquial words in the Fan Wan [[分韻]]
is the disregard the Cantonese pay to them in their writing, as
no one would degrade his composition by inserting them. This
rejection has had the result of keeping the greater part of them
unwritten, and the compilers of the Fan Wan, knowing no authorized
characters by which to express them, nor having any tabular
system of initials and finals in which to insert them so that the
student could find them, have omitted them. In fact, except in these
two ways, a Chinese actually has no possible means to express
a sound, and the latter mode is so clumsy and unsatisfactory that it
would probably be understood by few natives who use the book.
--

--{.williams}
The adoption of proper characters to denote these unwritten
sounds is a troublesome matter for a native writer, and it is not surprising
that he avoids their use. However, they are occasionally
written, but not all on the same principles. Sometimes a well-known
character of the same tone is selected to express the sound; and its
evidently utter inaptitude in the connection to express any sense is
depended upon to intimate that it is used for a colloquial word.
This expedient is frequently employed by partly educated persons
in letters, when they do not know, or cannot remember the proper
characters. Another device to indicate colloquial words is to prefix
the character _hau_ [[hau]] 口 mouth, or _yan_ [[jan]] 人 a man, at the side of some
well known character of the same sound, but not always of the same
tone. The words _tsoi(6)_ [[zoi6]] 儎 a cargo; _(1)k(a/) (2)fo_ [[gaa1 fo2]] 傢伙, furniture;
_(5)mai_ [[mai5]] 咪 do not; _(1)ts(')oi_ [[coi1]] 啋 pshaw! and _(2)t(e/)_ [[de2]] 嗲 remiss, &c., are examples
[[[Page~xiii of the original]{#page-xiii}<n20> here]]
of this sort. Sometimes, again, a character which comes nearest in
tone is taken to represent the needed sound, and the knowledge of
the reader is expected to inform him that it is employed in a vulgar
sense. The words _(1)n(i/)n_ [[nin1]] 年 milk; _(1)l(a/)n_ [[laan1]] 欄 a bazaar; and _(1)n(a/)i_ [[naai1]] 奶 a lady,
are examples of this practice. Again, characters having
nearly the same meaning as the colloquial word, but of an entirely
different sound, are adopted, so that even if the reader does not know
the vulgar sound he will make no mistake as to the sense. Thus,
the words _(1)hung_ [[hung1]] 烘 to roast, used for _(1)nung_ [[nung1]], to scorch, to scowl;
_[(2)]hung_ [[hung2]] 孔 a hole, used for _(1)lung_ [[lung1]]; are instances of this mode of adaptation.
Lastly, entirely new characters are made for some of them; as
_lat_ [[lat]] 甪 to detach, _p(a/)ng_ [[baang]] 碰 a knock, which of course have no currency
in other parts of China, as neither their sound or meaning
will be known elsewhere. Besides these, there are a few colloquial
words, as _fing_ [[fing]], _kwit_ [[gwit]], _fik_ [[fik]], ap [[ap]], &c., for which no characters can be
found, and which cannot therefore be written at all.
--

--{.williams}
The best course to adopt respecting the colloquial words found
in this dialect, has been a matter of considerable perplexity in the
preparation of this Dictionary. There being so many modes to
express them, it was concluded to follow that plan for each character,
which seemed to be the best understood among the people.
The student must not however place much dependence on many of
the characters employed to denote these unwritten sounds, for they
are not uniformly represented, and other persons would perhaps
choose different characters. The colloquial meanings of a word
are usually distinguished from the more authorized definitions, so
that no trouble will, it is hoped, be found on this score to those who
use the dictionary in other parts of China, where the colloquial is
entirely different.
--

--{.williams}
The characters are classed in the Fan Wan [[分韻]] under thirty-three
finals, whose sounds are represented by standard and well known
characters, as given in the annexed Table, all of them in the four
upper tones, except the two last finals. The characters in the second
half have been selected from the body of the book to illustrate the
lower tones, and to aid the scholar in discriminating the two series.
There, are however actually fifty-three finials in the dialect, if we
include the terminations in the fourth tone.

[[[Page~xvi of the original]{#page-xvi}<n23> here]]
The variations heard in the pronunciation of words under these
thirty-three finals, though rather perplexing, bear only a small proportion
to the whole number of words in the language. The most
usual discrepancies heard under each order are here given, but it is
impossible, and would be useless, to exhibit every alteration from
what the Fan Wan [[分韻]] represents as the proper sound. On the whole
that manual may be regarded as a fair exhibition of the general pronunciation.
Other modes of spelling the same sounds, adopted by
Dr.~Morrison, Mr.~Devan and Mr.~Bonney, in their vocabularies of
this dialect, and by others who have tried to write them, are given
in parenthesis under each number.
--

{+++
--
(Here, I have made some guesses for the phonetics of 19th-century Cantonese,
by reconciling Williams' description against modern Cantonese phonology.
It should be noted that 19th-century English vowels differ slightly
from those in what would today be called Received Pronunciation;
see [vowel shift chart].)

+++}

++{.williams}
1.{#final-order-1}
  _S(i/)n_, s(i/)t,
  like _seen_, _seat_, _peat_, _mean_.
  Several of the words commencing with a vowel,
  as _(i/)n_ 言, _(i/)n_ 現, _(i/)t_ 熱, are heard with
  a nasal or aspirate, as _ng(i/)n_, _h(i/)n_, _ng(i/)t_.
  _(Seen, leet.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(i/)n_ = *[iːn], and _(i/)t_ = *[iːt̚].)
  --
  +++}

2.{#final-order-2}
  _Wai_,
  like _buy_, _nigh_.
  Words under this final occasionally run
  into the longer sound of _(a/)i_ in the [14th~order](#final-order-14), especially in those
  like _kwai_ and _shai_.
  _(Lei, wī, fy.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _ai_ = *[ɐi]. 19th-century English /ʌi/ is almost indistinguishable.)
  --
  +++}

3.{#final-order-3}
  _K(i/)_,
  like _me_, _flee_.
  A few words beginning with _k_, _p_ and _f_, are
  frequently heard like the [\[29th\]~final](#final-order-29),
  as _k(i/)_ 騎, _p(i/)_ 俾, _f(i/)_ 非, _k(i/)_ 己,
  pronounced _k(e/)_, _p(e/)_, _f(e/)_, or _k(e/)_; but this is the exception. Others
  having no initial, as (i/) 二, (i/) 耳 are often heard _ng(i/)_.
  _(Tee, she, ki.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(i/)_ = *[iː].)
  --
  +++}

4.{#final-order-4}
  _Ch(u:)_,
  like _sue_, or the first part of the word _choose_. Words in
  this order beginning with _h_, _l_, _n_, and _ts_,
  are often heard sliding into
  _hui_, _lui_, _nui_, _tsui_,
  like the [22d~order](#final-order-22), as 去, 侶, 女, 聚, 序;
  those under the other initials are less frequently mispronounced.
  _(Kuy, sue, n(u/), loÿ, u.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(u:)_ = *[yː].)
  --
  +++}

5.{#final-order-5}
  _Sau_,
  like _now_, _cow_, _how_.
  Words in this order like _au_ 漚, 嘔,
  having no initial, often seem to a beginner to lengthen the vowels
  into _(a/)u_, like the [18th~order](#final-order-18), as also do those like
  _chau_ 肘 _hau_ 后 and _p(')au_, 剖
  but a little practice will discriminate them.
  _(Tsow, shaw, hāw.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _au_ = *[ɐu]. 19th-century English /ɑu/ is almost indistinguishable.)
  --
  +++}

6.{#final-order-6}
  _Tung_, _tuk_,
  like the Irishism _wroong_ for _wrung_, and so nearly
  _toong_, _took_, that it is [doubtful] whether this final ought not to be
  written _t(u/)ng_, _t(u/)k_; it must never be sounded like the English words
  _sung_, _hung_, _tongue_.
  There are no variants in this final worth noticing.
  _(Soong, yok, tōk.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _ung_ = *[oŋ], and _uk_ = *[ok̚].
  This is based on interpreting Williams' "so nearly _toong_, _took_"
  as meaning slightly more open than /ʊŋ/ and /ʊk/, wherefore [oŋ] and [ok̚].)
  --
  +++}

7.{#final-order-7}
[[[Page~xvii of the original]{#page-xvii}<n24> here]]
  _Ying_, _yik_,
  like _sing_, _king_, _quick_, _wing_.
  So many words under this order change the final into _eng_ and _ek_,
  that a separate list has been made of them in the general Table of Sounds,
  but the proportion is small;
  all the common words are noticed in the body of the Dictionary.
  At Macao [[澳門]] and thereabouts, a large proportion change
  the final into _ang_ and _ak_ of the [15th~order](#final-order-15),
  as 兄, 京, 明, 擰, 兵,
  into _hang_, _kang_, _mang_,
  _nang_, _pang_, &c., by which the people from
  Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]] district are recognized at Canton [[廣州]].
  _(Leng, paëng, te-ang, saung.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _ing_ = *[ɪŋ], _ik_ = *[ɪk̚], _eng_ = *[ɛŋ], and _ek_ = *[ɛk̚].)
  --
  +++}

8.{#final-order-8}
  _Pan_, _pat_,
  like _fun_, _son_, _shun_, _tun_, _won_,
  never like _man_, _fan_, _hat_, _cat_.
  Variants in the _yap shing_ [[jap sing 入聲]],
  passing into the long sound _(a/)t_
  of the [25th~order](#final-order-25), are occasionally heard, but a more frequent change
  is into _p(i/)n_, _p(i/)t_, or _pen_, _pet_, which is peculiar to the people of the
  districts of Sinhwui [[新會]] and K(a/)uy(a/)u [[高要]] southwest of Canton [[廣州]].
  _(Pun, kăn, fut, yet, chăt.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _an_ = *[ɐn], and _at_ = *[ɐt̚]. English /ʌ/ is almost indistinguishable from [ɐ].)
  --
  +++}

9.{#final-order-9}
  _Ch(e/)ung_, _ch(e/)uk_,
  like the combined sounds in _say 'em_; there
  is no English word with this diphthong.
  The variations in this final are rare.
  _(Chaong, cheong, lay-ung, yok, naung, tsay-uk.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(e/)ung_ = *[eoŋ], and _(e/)uk_ = *[eok̚].)
  --
  +++}

10.{#final-order-10}
  _Kong_, _kok_,
  like _long_, _song_, _wrong_, _hawk_, _baulk_;
  never like _sock_, _lock_.
  There is no difficulty in recognizing all words under
  this final, even when as is occasionally the case, they are heard like
  _l(o\)ng_.
  _(Pawng, kawk, l(o/)k, w(o/)ng, hoak, tsoang.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _ong_ = *[ɔːŋ], and _ok_ = *[ɔːk̚].)
  --
  +++}

11.{#final-order-11}
  _K(u/)_, _l(o\)_,
  as _coo_, _cuckoo_, _lo_, _hoe_, _flow_.
  The compilers of the Fan Wan [[分韻]] seem to have been unable to distinguish the characters
  under this final into the two terminations of _(u/)_ and _(o\)_,
  and have combined them apparently because in the court dialect most of
  them ended in _(u/)_. Those beginning with _l_, _m_,
  _sh_, and _s_ slide
  from _l(u/)_, _m(u/)_, _s(u/)_, _sh(u/)_,
  into _l(o\)_, _m(o\)_, _sh(o\)_, _s(o\)_,
  but under other initials there is
  no trouble in distinguishing them.
  _(Lo, low, ku, foo.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(u/)_ = *[uː], and _(o\)_ = *[ou].)
  --
  +++}

12.{#final-order-12}
  _Chi(u/)_,
  like _new_, _few_,
  both vowels being plainly sounded.
  This final is now and then heard like _(e/)u_,
  as 要 _(e/)u_ for _i(u/)_; 溺 _n(e/)u_ for _ni(u/)_;
  and also sliding into the [4th](#final-order-4) as 曉 _h(u:)_ for _hi(u/)_.
  _(Kew, chiu, tee-ue, t(i/)(u/).)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _i(u/)_ = *[iːu].
  From [Eitel (1877)][eitel-iu], "a little more prominence is given to the sound _i_",
  wherefore [iːu] instead of [iuː].)
  --
  [eitel-iu]: https://books.google.com/books?id=mh8TAAAAYAAJ&jtp=xiv
  +++}

13.{#final-order-13}
  _(U:)n_, (u:)t,
  like the _u_ in _ruin_, _June_, _jute_, _dilute_.
  The variations under this final are unimportant, and those are where the vowel is
  changed in a few words to _è_, as 煖 _nèn_ for _n(u:)n_.
  _(Heuet, sh(u/)n, (u/)t, une, sute.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(u:)n_ = *[yːn], and _(u:)t_ = *[yːt̚].)
  --
  +++}

14.{#final-order-14}
[[[Page~xviii of the original]{#page-xviii}<n25> here]]
  _K(a/)i_,
  like _aye_, _aisle_,
  never shortened into _nigh_, _fly_, like the
  [2d~final](#final-order-2), though that frequently is prolonged into this. The Chinese
  discriminate between the diphthongs _ai_ and _(a/)i_ with much accuracy,
  and the student should pay particular attention to them at first, or
  he will constantly confound them.
  _(Pai, nie, tì, k(a/)i, kye.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(a/)i_ = *[aːi].)
  --
  +++}

15.{#final-order-15}
  _Tang_, _tak_,
  like _tongue_, _sung_, _hung_, _muck_, _luck_,
  never like _hang_, _bang_, _jack_, _sack_.
  There are many words placed under this
  final, which from the constant tendency to lengthen the vowel are
  heard like the [32d~final](#final-order-32),
  as 生 _sh(a/)ng_ for _shang_, 行 _h(a/)ng_ for _hang_, 北 _p(a/)k_ for _pak_, &c.;
  many of these variations are noticed in the body of the work.
  _(Pung, hăng, tuk, măk, hek, sh(a/)ng, y(a/)k.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _ang_ = *[ɐŋ], and _ak_ = *[ɐk̚]. English /ʌ/ is almost indistinguishable from [ɐ].)
  --
  +++}

16.{#final-order-16}
  _Sz'_, _tsz'_,
   like no words in the English language, but much
   like a hiss. The people of Canton [[廣州]] itself pronounce these two words
   very clearly, but in the villages around and south of it, they are
   changed into _sh(i/)_, _s(u:)_, _sz(u:)_, _sch(i/)_, _ts(u:)_, _ts(i/)_, _ch(')(i/)_,
   so that in many cases it is hard to recognize them.
   _(Sze, sz, sse, ss', tse.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _z'_ = *[ɿː].
  Note that the symbol ɿ (now considered obsolete) was historically used
  by Sinologists for the so-called apical rime.)
  --
  +++}

17.{#final-order-17}
  _Kam_, _kap_,
  like _hum_, _some_, _come_, _sup_, _tup_,
  never like _ham_, _rap_, nor _came_, _lame_, _nape_, _rape_.
  A few words properly referred to this final lengthen the vowel into
  _k(a/)m_, _k(a/)p_, like the [24th](#final-order-24), and others
  also are changed into short _e_, as _kem_, _nem_.
  _(Yum, shup, lăm[,] shăp.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _am_ = *[ɐm], and _ap_ = *[ɐp̚]. English /ʌ/ is almost indistinguishable from [ɐ].)
  --
  +++}

18.{#final-order-18}
  _K(a/)u_,
  like _how_ very much prolonged; the difference between
  this, and the [5th~final](#final-order-5) is merely in the longer sound of the _(a/)_.
  There are no variations in pronunciation worth noticing in this final.
  _(Pow, kaou, chaow.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(a/)u_ = *[aːu].)
  --
  +++}

19.{#final-order-19}
  _Tsoi_,
  like _boy_, _noise_, _loiter_.
  The _oi_ in some of the words referred to [in] this final,
  inclines to _ui_ of the [22d](#final-order-22), as 來 內 台 _lui_, _nui_, _t[(')]ui_,
  for _loi_, _noi_, _t[(')]oi_, but a little care will easily discriminate
  them; most of the words are uniformly sounded.
  _(Toy, suy.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _oi_ = *[ɔɪ].)
  --
  +++}

20.{#final-order-20}
  _K(i/)m_, _k(i/)p_,
  like _cream_, _seem_, _team_, _sheep_, _reap_.
  The words under this final are very uniform, and there is no particular
  character worth noticing as a variant.
  _(Keem, leep.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _(i/)m_ = *[iːm], and _(i/)p_ = *[iːp̚].)
  --
  +++}

21.{#final-order-21}
  _Tsun_, _tsut_,
  like the _u_ in _put_, _nuisance_, the sound lying
  between the vowel sounds in _fun_ and _fool_,
  in the [8th](#final-order-8) and [27th orders](#final-order-27);
  the [8th](#final-order-8), [21st](#final-order-21) and [27th finals](#final-order-27) _pan_, _tsun_, _k(u/)n_,
  are kept very distinct by the Chinese, and must not be confounded. It is not
  easy to distinguish the _u_ in this order
  from the _u_ in _tung_, _tuk_, as
  some have endeavored to do, for if the word _tsun_ be slowly prolonged
  [[[Page~xix of the original]{#page-xix}<n26> before 'ed']] into _tsung_,
  it will be seen the difference is in the quantity rather
  than in the quality of the vowel.
  _(Tsun, soot.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _un_ = *[ʊn], and _ut_ = *[ʊt̚].)
  --
  +++}

22.{#final-order-22}
  _Sui_,
  a combination of _u_ in the preceding order with _i_; there is
  no similar sound in English. Words under the [4th~final](#final-order-4)
  commencing with _s_, _l_ or _n_,
  easily run into this, and some of those placed here,
  as _tsui_, _yui_, _tui_,
  also run into the [28th~order](#final-order-28). The Chinese, who are
  not fettered or guided by any alphabetic sounds, often discriminate
  these nearly homophonous words better than we do.
  _(Suy, mooy, soÿ, shoo-e.)_

  {+++
  --
  (Best guess: _ui_ = *[ʊɪ].)
  --
  +++}

23.{#final-order-23}
  _Fo_,
  like _law_, _saw_, _taw_,
  not _lo_, _no_, _two_;
  the _o_ as in _long_, _sawn_,
  as in the [10th](#final-order-10) and [30th orders](#final-order-30).

  _F(a/)n_, _f(a/)t_,
  like _Jahn_, _father_,
  not like _fan_, _fat_, _man_, _mat_.
  In the district of Shunteh [[順德]], some characters in this order take a
  singular change to _èn_, as 間 _hèn_ (like _mane_), 板 _pèn_, 鹹 _kèn_ (like _cane_),
  and so of others.
  _(Wan, pann, fat.)_

  --
  +++}

26.{#final-order-26}

28.{#final-order-28}
  _F(u/)i_ is a well defined diphthong,
  like _buoy_,
  broader than _sui_ in the [22d~order](#final-order-22),
  and having only one initial in common with that;
  the consonant has much influence on the quantity of the vowel.

###{#initials .williams} List of the Initials.


--{.williams}
No list of initials is given in the Fan Wan [[分韻]]; there are twenty-three
in all, which are here represented by the following characters.
The first one is a mute, and used when the final only is pronounced,
having no consonant before it.
--
++{.williams}
1. Au 毆 [[null initial]]
2. Chi 之 [[Best guess: _ch_ = *[tɕ]^]]

--{.williams}
The diversities in the initials are so much fewer than those in the
finals, that they are soon described, though for their number they
give more trouble, perhaps, than the others.
--
===={.williams}
- 1. All words having no initial consonant, are very liable to have
  a nasal _ng_ or an _h_ prefixed to them, or to have the vowel altered.
  The people in Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]], Macao [[澳門]], and Sin-ng(a/)n [[新安]], change many words
  in this way, so that if one does not see the character, he will look
  for it under _h_ or _ng_.

-{#initials-ch-ts}
  2,~20. The initials _ch_ and _ts_ are constantly confounded, and some
  persons are absolutely unable to detect the difference, more frequently
  calling the words under _ts_ as _ch_, than contrariwise.
  All characters
  [[[Page~xxi of the original]{#page-xxi}<n28> before 'racters']]
  with the sounds _tsz'_ and _ts(')z'_ are liable to be heard _ch(i/)_ and
  _ch(')(i/)_, with a stronger breathing than those properly read _ch(i/)_ and
  _ch(')(i/)_.

  {+++
  --
  (For more discussion,
  see [note on pre-merger initials](/phonology/#pre-merger-initials)
  in the modern Cantonese phonology page.)
  --
  +++}

- 4. The people along the coast and south of Canton [[廣州]] often alter the
  initial _f_ into _h_ or _w_ in some words, and retain it in others; it
  changes sooner before _(a/)_ or _a_,
  than before _(i/)_ or _u_.

- 10,~11. The two initials _l_ and _m_ are frequently so interchanged in
  the mouths of some people, that one is much puzzled to distinguish
  them, and even _n_ is altered too;
    as _l(a/)m_ 南 for _n(a/)m_;
    _m(a/)n_ 欄 for _l(a/)n_;
    _l(o\)_ 奴 for _n(o\)_;
    &c.
  The number of such words is not very
  great, and while the few who speak thus cannot discriminate the
  [initial] consonant before some vowels, they never interchange them
  before others.

-{#initials-sh-s}
  16,~17. The initial _sh_ is called _s_ along the coast;
  in the districts of Hi(a/)ngsh(a/)n [[香山]], Sinning [[新寧]] and Sinngan [[新安]],
  this obtains to a very great extent;
  _shui_ 水, _sh(u:)_ 書, _shuk_ 熟, _sh(a/)ng shing_ 省城, &c. &c.,
  being heard _sui_, _s(u:)_, _suk_, and _s(a/)ng sing_, as in the Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] and Amoy [[廈門]]
  dialects. The initial _sh_ is a complete shibboleth to the people of
  those districts. West of Canton [[廣州]], many are found who change _sz'_
  into _s(u:)_, and a large part of the words beginning with _s_ are changed
  into _sh_ just the opposite of the usage at Macao [[澳門]].

--{.williams}
These five classes of changes are the most frequent, and with
those in the finals may perhaps discourage the beginner whether he
be able to learn a speech which varies so much in its pronunciation.
The proportion the variants bear to the whole body of characters
is not so great, however, as he might conclude, and when once
ascertained it will not be difficult to follow them; besides which, no
individual will ever be found who has them all.

The above comprise all the vowels, diphthongs and consonants,
found in the Canton [[廣州]] dialect. In addition the Court Dialect contains
a few more, and as the pronunciation of each character in the
[[[Page~xxiii of the original]{#page-xxiii}<n30> here]]
Fan Wan [[分韻]] is given in that dialect under it, they are here added.
For the sounds given to the characters in this dialect, the dictionaries
of De~Guignes, Morrison, Gonçalves, and Medhurst, nearly
agree throughout; and though what is termed the _kw(a/)n hw(a/)_ [[官話]] differs
as much as any of the local dialects, when it is heard in different
parts of the country, still there is a general resemblance. This
system is more strictly that which is known among the Chinese as
the _N(a/)n hw(a/)_ [[南華]] or Southern dialect, in contradistinction to the _Peh hw(a/)_ [[北華]]
or Northern dialect, the cities of N(a/)nking [[南京]] and Peking [[北京]] respectively
being regarded as the standards of authority of the two. The
additional finals and initials found in the Court Dialect alone are the
following:---
--
=={.williams}
- _ei_, nearly as in _weigh_,
  but very open, both vowels being heard.
- _i(a/)_, as in _yard_, _piastre_, both vowels plainly heard.
- _i(a/)h_, like the last, [but] ending abruptly.
- _i(a/)i_, a triphthong, each letter of which is heard.
- _i(a/)ng_, like _i(a/)h_, except the final _ng_; both are pronounced broad.
- _i(a/)u_, _i(e/)_, _ieh_, _ien_, _ih_, _in_, _ioh_, _iueh_, _iuen_, _iuh_, _iun_, and _iung_, are all
  to be sounded distinctly, the _i_ to be plainly enunciated before the other letters.
- _oh_, is an abrupt ending, like _knock_, though not so decided.
- _ueh_, _uen_, and _uh_, are all to be sounded distinctly. All words ending
  in~_h_, are in the _jih shing_ [[入聲]], but it is generally so soft as to lead
  many to say that this tone does not occur in the court dialect.
==

--{.williams}
By combining all the fifty-three finals with all the twenty-three
initials, there would be 1229 [[I get 53~×~23 = 1219]] sounds in the dialect which could be
represented by Roman letters; there are however only 707 different
syllables given in this Dictionary, many possible combinations, as
_kw(o\)m_, _t(a/)ng_, _l(u/)t_, _p(u:)t_,
_kw(e/)ung_, _f(a/)m_, _foi_, _lon_,
_shot_, _s(u/)n_, _[wi(u/)]_, &c.,
not [occurring] in the dialect. The table of all the sounds here given
will show the paucity of different vocables, though it does not
probably include *all* the variations heard among the people, which
however most frequently run into other sounds occurring in the table,
and do often exhibit new sounds. The list of finals in the first
column is arranged according to the table from the Fan Wan [[分韻]] on
[page~xiv](#page-xiv), and not alphabetically.
--

--{.williams}
[["Table of Sounds in the Canton Dialect"
covers [Page~xxiv of the original]{#page-xxiv}<n31>
and [Page~xxv of the original]{#page-xxv}<n32>;
omitted here due to its size.]]
--

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xxvi of the original]{#page-xxvi}<n33> here]]
The final _h(u\)_ [[hoe]], _k(u\)_ [[goe]], _l(u\)_ [[loe]] &c.,
in the last line but one in this Table,
is not found in the Fan Wan [[分韻]] at all; the compilers appear to have
thought it unnecessary to add a whole order and another final for
the sake of one character, _h(u\)_ [[hoe]] 靴 a boot, the only one in the dialect
not vulgar or colloquial.
--

--{.williams}
It will prove serviceable for the student to make out a table of
characters to correspond to this table of sounds, and read them
across and down with a native, so as to notice the effect made on
a final by changing the initial, and the alterations produced on an
initial under many finals. Reading over such a table a dozen times
with as many educated natives, will give as distinct an idea of the
changes which characters undergo in their sounds in the speech of
different persons, as can be obtained.
--

--{.williams}
There have been attempts to follow up these changes in writing
this dialect in Roman letters, but in all cases it is better to adhere
to the classified arrangement given in the Fan Wan [[分韻]], and remember
the exceptions as being such. In the vocabularies and phrase-books
of Dr.~Morrison, Mr.~Devan and Mr.~Bonney, no attention has been
paid to the classes of finals as given in the Fan Wan, or to the tones
or aspirates, and the errors in writing the words are numerous, even
according to their own modes of spelling.
--

--{.williams}
The system of writing Chinese sounds here followed, has been
adopted, with some slight variations, in writing other dialects of
the language; but it would be a great advantage to all[ ]students in it
if all the modes of spelling the dialects could be harmonized. It is
not supposed, by this remark, that this one is the best which could
be proposed, for some features of it could be modified to advantage,
but it certainly is more accurate for the student's use than to follow
the common English alphabet, with all its strange anomalies. The
various modes of writing each sound, as quoted after the remarks on
pp.~[xvi](#page-xvi)....[xix](#page-xix), show how much difficulty has been felt by those who
have tried to write them according to the English alphabet.
--

--{.williams}
Mr.~Goddard, in his Ti(e/)chi(u/) [[潮州]] Vocabulary, uses _(a/)_, _a_ and _(u\)_ as in this
table, but _e_, _i_, _i_, _(o/)_, and _u_, are substituted by him
for the _(e/)_, _(i/)_, _(o\)_, _o_, and _(u/)_,
in this table. He did not perceive that he was confusing his
own pronunciation by representing the _(i/)_ in _machine_ and in _pin_ by
the same letter; as he was by blending the _e_ in _they_ and _men_. At
[[[Page~xxvii of the original]{#page-xxvii}<n34> here]]
Amoy [[廈門]], unaccented vowels have been used, and the tones marked
by accents over the letters, which is likely still more to confuse
those who may try to read the sounds in that dialect, as a single
quotation will show.

The differences between all these modes of writing Chinese sounds
are really not very great, for in none of them has the English alphabet
been followed, and it would not be very difficult to reconcile
them to one standard, an object which appears still more desirable
when the plan of Romanizing them for the use of unlearned natives
is taken into the account. Perhaps it would, however, be best to
discard them all, and adopt Lepsius' universal alphabet, with which
he proposes to harmonize the mode of writing all languages.

##{#tones .williams} 2. The Tones.

--{.williams}
The _shing_ [[sing]] 聲 or tones form one of the most difficult and peculiar
features of the Chinese spoken language, but they can neither be
fully or easily described satisfactorily, for the reason that no European
language has them. Strictly speaking, they are neither tones,
modulations, accents, nor emphasis, as those words are usually
applied in western languages; they probably more nearly resemble
the sound of notes in music. The note _G_ on a violin, an organ, or
a bagpipe, strikes the ear very differently, like the voices of a child
or man; the note is alike on the gamut, and it chords on all those
instruments; but let _G_~sharp be struck on one of them, and we feel
the discord, it is not the note at all. So in respect to Chinese
_shing_; if the right _shing_ be not spoken, the right word is not spoken,
[[[Page~xxviii of the original]{#page-xxviii}<n35> here]]
it is some other word. For instance, if a person says _k(u/)(3)_ [[gu3]] instead
of _(1)k(u/)_ [[gu1]] 孤 an orphan, he does not say the word for _orphan_ at all;
he says that for 故 _old_, or 固 _firm_, or 顧 _to hire_, or some other
word equally remote in meaning. It is as if on the violin the player
strikes _G_~sharp, instead of _G_~natural; though he makes a note
he makes no chord with the organ or bagpipe sounding _G_~natural; as
it were, he speaks the wrong tone, and does not express his meaning.
It may not be indeed the case in Chinese, that the hearer will *always*
misunderstand the speaker even if the tones are pronounced wrong,
for there are additional clues to the meaning, but the chances are
against it.
--

--{.williams}
Many explanations and illustrations of the tones have been written,
but as no one can get a clear idea of them until he has begun to
learn them from speaking with the people, it does not seem to be
worth while here to repeat what has been said in other works upon
this subject; but simply to refer to those treatises,[\*](#page-xxviii-footnote-asterisk) and denote
the way in which they are marked in this Dictionary. What adds to the
difficulty of understanding the differences between the tones, is that
the same name is applied by the natives to really different tones in
different dialects; in which, to complicate the matter still further,
the tone of the same character is sometimes changed; consequently,
a person can hardly be sure that what is applicable to one dialect, is
descriptive of the same thing in another. The Chinese have written
about the tones to some extent, but their definitions, from the nature
of the subject, do not help foreigners much. The people learn the
pronunciation of words by the ear, and refer to a dictionary when
in doubt about the tone, just as we do to Webster or Richardson
to get the right spelling, but not to learn what the tones are.

The compilers of the Fan Wan [[分韻]] have formally arranged the characters
under each final by the four tones; and have also further
separated the upper and lower series, and the aspirated characters
[[[Page~xxix of the original]{#page-xxix}<n36> here]]
into separate columns, though they have not so distinctly specified
them. The eight tones as given in the Table on pages~[xiv](#page-xiv), [xv](#page-xv), are
clearly distinguished by the Cantonese, and every word in this
Dictionary has been marked according to its tone by semicircles,
something like the mark used by the Chinese, as here exhibited.

There is more attention paid to the _(4)p(')ing (1)shing_ [[ping4 sing1 平聲]] or monotone,
in its upper and lower inflection, than any other, and while the
three last are collectively called _chak(7) (1)shing_ [[zak1 sing1]] 仄聲 or deflected
tones, the first retains its name. If the beginner gets a good idea
and practice of the _(4)p(')ing (1)shing_ [[ping4 sing1 平聲]], therefore, he will more easily get
the others. The _(5)sh(e/)ung (1)shing_ [[soeng5 sing1 上聲]] is also called the ascending or rising
tone; the _h(u:)(3) (1)shing_ [[heoi3 sing1 去聲]] the departing or falling tone;
and the _yap(9) (1)shing_ [[jap6 sing1 入聲]]
the entering or abrupt tone; these appellations are simply the literal
renderings of the native terms.
--

--{.williams}
As the tones in Chinese are totally distinct from accent, in their
own or other languages, there are many objections to using the
common and generally understood marks (as ◌́ ◌̀ ◌̆ ◌̂ ) on the tops of
the vowels to denote them, as has been done in romanizing some
dialects, and in the dictionaries of De~Guignes, Medhurst, and
others. By taking another sign, there is no mixing of radically
different symbols over the same syllable, as in _këèn_, _kŏ̍yh_, _mëⁿā_, _só͘_,
where one of the marks affects the power of the vowels, and the
other denotes the tone of the Chinese character. Since diacritical
marks in all European languages modify the power of the vowels,
it is desirable not to introduce any confusion in writing words, the
more so as the tones in Chinese are so entirely different; it is better
to adopt a new symbol.
--

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xxx of the original]{#page-xxx}<n37> here]]
The Burmese, Siamese, and Shyan languages all possess something
resembling the Chinese tones. The Burmese have two marks,
a _shay-pouk_ (း) [[U+1038]] and an _anmyeet_ (့) [[U+1037]] to denote the different tones or
stress of voice, which changes the signification of words. The
Chinese denote a different tone in a few common bilingual characters
by marking them on that corner which is held to correspond to the
required tone, as 會〬 [[wui6]] 惡〪 [[wu1]] 難〬 [[naan6]] 王〬 [[wong6]] 度〭 [[dok6]], though this is not always done.
[[Font support for these tone marks is known to be poor on Windows and iOS;
check [Font test page](/font-test/).]]
No books are ever printed with the tones marked to each
character, for the reason that every person who can read is deemed
to be acquainted with them.
--

--{.williams}
The Chinese do not distinguish the upper or lower series when they
mark the tones, nor do they mark the aspirated characters. They
have not even a well known definite term to denote the aspirate, the
phrase _p(')an h(i/)_ [[pan3 hei3]] 噴氣 being rather of foreign than native origin, and
one which every native scholar does not understand without some
explanation. It is represented usually by a Greek spiritus asper
[ʻ] [[U+02BB; these square brackets appear in the original text]],
or an inverted comma [‘] [[U+2018; these square brackets appear in the original text]],
when the former [can] not be obtained,
to which some add an _h_ also, as _ch(')hang_, _t(')ho_, _p(')han_, _t(')hik_, but not
wisely, for there is danger of confounding it with such English
words as _fan_, _though_, _thick_.
--

--{.williams}
In order to learn the tones and aspirates, it is desirable for the
student to pay special attention for awhile to merely reading and
pronouncing the characters, irrespective of their meaning or form.
This should be done when commencing the study, for a vicious
pronunciation of the tones is seldom corrected; and one is less
liable to be misunderstood if he pronounces a word a little wrong,
as _heng_ [[heng]] for _hing_ [[hing]], _ch(e/)uk_ for _ts(e/)uk_ [[now merged into zoek]], than if he gives it the wrong tone.
For instance, a native will consider this sentence in the Canton
dialect 擰一張床呢處, less barbarously pronounced if he
hears it _(1)ling yet(7) (1)ch(a/)ng (4)ts(')ong (1)n(i/) sh(')(u:)(3)_
[[ling1 jet1 zaang1 cong4 ni1 syu3]], with all the tones correct,
than if it should be spoken _ning(6) yat(9) (2)ch(e/)ung ch(')ong(3) n(i/)(3) (1)ch[(')](u:)_
[[ning6 jat6 zoeng2 cong3 ni3 cyu1]], with
all the tones wrong, which would perhaps be nonsense to him.
--

--{.williams}
The Table given on pages~[xiv](#page-xiv), [xv](#page-xv), should be thoroughly learned,
by reading it backwards and forwards, until the distinction between
the first three tones in both series is seen. A good practice also is
to read over the tables of characters given in the Fan Wan [[分韻]] under
[[[Page~xxxi of the original]{#page-xxxi}<n38> here]]
each final in the first part of it, where all the initials found under
each one are arranged by the tones. Thus, under the 27th~final [[un]],
these leading characters are thus arranged, the upper coming before
the lower series.

The practice of repeatedly reading these collections of characters
under each final, with a teacher, closely following his voice and
accent, will give the beginner as clear an idea of the difference
between the eight tones as he can get, and the practice he needs
at the same time. Foreigners speak generally in a higher key than
natives, and pronounce most words in the _(4)p(')ing (1)shing_ [[ping4 sing1 平聲]], even when
the termination shows that it is in the _yap(9) (1)shing_ [[jap6 sing1 入聲]]. There are far
more words, too, in the _(4)p(')ing (1)shing_ than in any other two tones.
--

--{.williams}
Another exercise which can be followed with advantage, is to
read sentences artificially constructed of characters having the same
final, like the following:---
--
=={.williams}
- _(5)Ling (2)ting (1)ying (4)ming_
  [[ling5 ding2 jing1 ming4]] 嶺頂鷹鳴
  the eagle is screaming on the hilltop.

- _(1)T[(')](a/)n (1)k(a/)n ng(a/)n(6) (2)f(a/)n_
  [[taan1 gaan1 ngaan6 faan2]] 灘間鴈返
  the geese are gamboling in the rapids.

- _Fuk(7) uk(7) luk(9) shuk(7)_
  [[fuk1 uk1 luk6 suk1]] 複屋鹿宿
  the deer sleeps in the back shed.

- _(1)P(a/) (1)p(a/) (2)p(a/) (2)p(a/) (4)p[(')](a/) (4)p[(')](a/) t(i/)(6)_
  [[baa1 baa1 baa2 baa2 paa4 paa4 dei6]] ::爸爸把把[耙耙]地::
  papa rakes the ground with a rake.

- _(5)Yau (4)yau tau(6) (2)tsau (4)k(')au (2)sau shau(6)_
  [[jau5 jau4 dau6 zau2 kau4 sau2 sau6]] 有油荳酒求叟售
  ask the old man to buy my oil, pulse, or wine.

- _(5)K(')au (5)yau tau(6) (2)kau (2)tau, (5)k(')(u:) (1)t(')au tsau(6) [(2)]tsau_
  [[kau5 jau5 dau6 gau2 dau2 keoi5 tau1 zau6 zau2]] 舅有荳九斗佢偷就走
  he stole ten pecks of uncle's beans and ran off.

- [[[Page~xxxii of the original]{#page-xxxii}<n39> here]]
  _(5)Ming (2)ting (1)ping (1)ting (4)t(')ing (5)t(')ing t(')ing(3)_
  [[ming5 ding2 bing1 ding1 ting4 ting5 ting3]] 酩酊兵丁停梃聽
  a drunken soldier leaned on his staff to listen.
==

--{.williams}
Exercises like these, accompanied with frequent reading of the
characters, at the same time committing selected sentences to memory,
may seem a waste of time and labor to the beginner, but
afterwards he will perceive the advantages. The matter of learning
the tones accurately is one of simple imitation, as one learns a tune,
or to mimic the voice of another, rather than to find out their nature
and then train the voice according to certain rules.
--

--{.williams}
The importance paid them by natives appears to have been an
effort to avoid the confusion which must ensue in speaking so many
homophonous words, unless there was something to distinguish them
to the ear. The Chinese spoken language is so meagre in vocables
that it is no surprise that those who speak it should endeavor to qualify
the tones, and vary the modulation of the syllables in every way
they can, if by so doing they can add to the accuracy of their speech
and facilitate conversation. In this Dictionary, for instance, there
are eighty-one characters included under the syllables _k(i/)_ [[gei]] and _k(')(i/)_ [[kei]]:
and a native will so pronounce each one that in most cases he will
be understood without much difficulty, though the context, and the
dissyllabic phrases in which some of the characters are used, may
perhaps assist as much as the right tone. But a foreigner would
find difficulty at first in detecting any difference in the pronunciation
of the whole number eighty-one, if a native should read them
off to him. The chief hindrance in learning these tones lies in
the want of practice in such delicate modulations---a practice quite
unnecessary to those speaking any European language---rather
than in any mystery as to their nature. Practice in speaking, with
close attention at first to the right sound, will soon give a habit that
will gradually become easy; if the student does not learn them in
this way, no rules can help him.

##{#plan .williams} 3. Plan of this Dictionary.

--{.williams}
This Dictionary is called a Tonic Dictionary, because the characters
in it are arranged under each syllable, according to their
tones, beginning with the _sh(e/)ung[(6)] (4)p(')ing (1)shing_ [[soeng6 ping4 sing1]] 上平聲 or upper monotone,
then the _h(a/)(6) (4)p(')ing (1)shing_ [[haa6 ping4 sing1]] 下平聲  or lower monotone,
followed by the _sh(e/)ung[(6)] (5)sh(e/)ung_ [[soeng6 soeng5]] 上上,
and _h(a/)(6) (5)sh(e/)ung_ [[haa6 soeng5]] 下上,
or upper and lower rising tone,
the _sh(e/)ung[(6)] h(u:)(3)_ [[soeng6 heoi3]] ::[上]去::, and
lastly the _h(a/)(6) h(u:)(3)_ [[haa6 heoi3]] 下去 or upper and lower retiring tone,
always in this same order. The other two tones,
the _sh(e/)ung[(6)] yap(9)_ [[soeng6 jap6]] 上入
and _h(a/)(6) yap(9)_ [[haa6 jap6]] 下入
will of course be found under other syllables.
--

{+++
--
(This modernised version of the Tonic Dictionary
is necessarily arranged differently to Williams' original:
--
++
1.
  --
  The syllables are arranged by the Jyutping spelling
  of the modern Hong Kong Cantonese pronunciation
  (see [Index of entry pages by Jyutping](/entries/))
  for practicality in the 21st~century,
  as no one except Conway cares about the Williams romanisation.
  --
  --
  In addition to the ordering being different,
  the groupings themselves will be different to the Williams groupings
  due to phonological changes that have occurred since the mid-19th~century
  (e.g.~the merging of the pairs _ts_ & _ch_, _ts(')_ & _ch(')_, and _s_ & _sh_).
  --

1.
  --
  For each syllable, the entries are sorted by Cantonese tone number.
  This means that non-entering tones are ordered by brightness (陰陽) first,
  and class (平上去) second; compare this to the olden/Williams sorting,
  which is by class (平上去) first, and brightness (陰陽) second.
  Entering tones are in the same order, but note that Jyutping uses
  non-entering aliases 1, 3, 6 instead of the olden numberings 7, 8, 9.
  --
++
--
Nevertheless, the Williams romanisations and the olden namings (陰陽平上去入)
are supplied alongside the modern Jyutping for reference.)
--
+++}

--{.williams}
In printing the volume, two main objects have been aimed at.
The first was to compress the essential part of a dictionary of the
Chinese language into a small space, and make as portable a volume
as could be done consistently with its usefulness, one which could
be carried with one when traveling, or handily used in learning
common characters. The second object grew out of the first: that
was to give all the examples in Roman letters only, the tone and aspirate
of each word being carefully marked. This plan had already
been tried in De~Guignes' Chinese Dictionary, but was not very useful
in that work in consequence of the characters being arranged under
their radicals and not by syllables, so that the student, who was not
already well acquainted with the characters, knew not where to turn
for them, even with the assistance of the tedious list of syllables
at the end. It was the want of Chinese type which compelled the
editor to publish that work as he did. The plan of Gonçalves was
an improvement on that of De~Guignes, for he inserted the characters
to his examples with their translations, omitting the sounds.
In the works of Morrison and Medhurst, both are given; in the
small work of Goddard, both are omitted, as no examples were contemplated
by the plan of his work.
--

--{.williams}
In the Fan Wan [[分韻]], the attempt has been made, by writing the sound
and tone of each word in every quotation, to enable the student,
with the help of the translation following it, to refer to all the characters
in it, by turning to them under their proper syllables. If
the characters had been introduced without their sounds, there
[[[Page~xxxiv of the original]{#page-xxxiv}<n41> here]]
would have been a saving of room, but not enough to make the book
its present size. Portability was deemed of so much importance,
that advantages incompatible with it were sacrificed. A single instance
will show how much the volume would have been increased
without adding a single sentence, if the characters had been inserted
in such type as is now available.
[[In the original print the Chinese characters were tall,
perhaps at <`~`>2em, as so: ::{style="font-size: 2em; vertical-align: middle;"}天地玄黃::.]]
When fonts of Chinese type
are made as small as they have occasionally been cut, (as ::{style="font-size: 1.3em; vertical-align: middle;"}誰識種:: [[<`~`>1.3em]],
or ::{style="font-size: 1em; vertical-align: middle;"}首章又歌基:: [[<`~`>1em]],)
it will be more practicable to introduce them.
--

||{.image-container}
  [![Side-by-side comparison showing that insertion of Chinese characters in the examples would take up about 50% more room.](page-xxxiv-comparison.png)]<n41>
||

--{.williams}
[[[Page~xxxv of the original]{#page-xxxv}<n42> here]]
Care has been taken to have all the characters quoted in the
examples contained in the book, so that when at a loss it can be
referred to. If there be any doubt as to which is the right one out of
a number, the meaning of the sentence will soon lead to it; and it
may be added that the habit of supplying the characters as one reads
over the quotations given in a definition, will tend to impress them
upon the memory, and make them familiar. If unluckily, the tone
has been placed wrong, or the syllable incorrectly printed, then the
meaning will aid in selecting the right character; but it is believed
that the errors in the quotations are not numerous. If the sound of
a character is not remembered, it can be found by referring to the
Index at the end. There is room on the margin for writing a few
characters when it is desired, and in many cases it will prove useful
to do so.
--

--{.williams}
In order to find a character in the Index, it is necessary first to
ascertain its radical, and then count the number of strokes made in
writing the rest of it. The largest part of the radicals are characters
in common use, and the student will do well to learn the whole
number thoroughly, so that he can tell their order and meaning. It
will not only be useful in looking up words in the Chinese lexicons,
but it will greatly assist him in remembering their composition and
meaning. The best mode of impressing the forms of the characters
on the memory is an important question; but in most cases, the
union of the radical and primitive, as *the* two parts to be remembered,
has the advantage of simplicity, and the sound and meaning can
be attached to these by the laws of association better than to a collection
of strokes made apparently without plan. After learning the
radicals, a careful examination of the primitives as given by Callery
will show the principles on which the great mass of characters in
the language are formed, and practice in reading and writing will
then make them familiar.
--

--{.williams}
Many of the most common characters are the most difficult to find
in the index; they are generally placed under the simpler radicals,
where they should be looked for first. For instance, 以, 仝, 令, 仄
are all under ⼈; 亞, 亘, 井, are under ⼆; 兒, 先, are under ⼉;
all of which are referred to these radicals chiefly
because it was a prominent part of the character, and likely to catch
[[[Page~xxxvi of the original]{#page-xxxvi}<n43> here]]
the eye. Such anomalous instances amount to about two hundred,
all of them primitives, while the remainder will give less trouble in
ascertaining the proper radical. About one half (108) of the radicals
are placed on the right or left of the primitive,---constituting one
half of the character, and easily recognized. Others, like ⼆, ⼓,
⼕[,] ⼖, ⼞, ⾏, ⾨ and ⾾ embrace the primitive, and give no
trouble. About 40 of them are placed on the top of the primitive,
a few of which enter into combination with it, as in 奉, 夷, 彝,
in such a manner as to give some hesitation as to the radical; while
others, as ⼧, ⼴, ⽧, ⽖, ⽳, ⽵, ⺫, ⺿, ⾌, ⾬, are more
apparent. For many the remainder, where the radical is either
in combination, or the character is formed of two or three radicals,
as 相, 聾, or 現, practice will soon give the necessary facility in
finding them. Some characters as 𢑷 [[original of 彙]], 𢐭 [[olden 喜]], 豑, 𨑊 [[⿰多農]], 𡳨 [[⿰杘桑]], 朅, made
up of two primitives, are usually placed with reference to their
meaning, and not to the most prominent part where they would be
looked for; but their number is small. An examination of the radicals
and the groups placed under them will be found in Williams'
Easy Lessons, pp.~4--29, and in Medhurst's Chinese and English
Dictionary, pp.~xvi--xxiv.
--
--{.williams}
In counting the number of strokes in a character, the radical is
not reckoned. After becoming familiar with the radicals themselves,
and having a general acquaintance with the primitives, the number
of strokes can most quickly be ascertained by inspection. For instance,
the character _m(u/)t(9)_ [[mut6]] 𩱷 [[⿱⿲弓⿰米蔑弓鬲]] rice porridge, found under the radical
_lik_ [[lik]] ⿀, is made up of 弓, 弓, 米, and [蔑], which severally
number 3, 3, 6, and 15~strokes, or 27 in all; the character _(i/)m(6)_ [[jim6]] 灎
bubbling water, placed under the radical _shui_ [[seoi]] ⽔, is composed
of 曲, 豆, 去, 皿, numbering 6, 7, 5, and 5~strokes, or 23 in
all. The number of characters formed of so many strokes as these
is very few, and in most cases a glance at the word is sufficient to
see how many make it.
