--{.williams}
[[Page~14*, before the last three entries for _chik(9)_ (zik6)]]
(The three next characters [[隻, 蹠跖, 炙]] are usually pronounced _chek_.)
[[Here, Williams has been misled by Fan Wan's placement of the three series
  跖蹠拓隻炙 (_chik_),
  尺 (_ch(')ik_), and
  石碩鼫 (_shik_)
*after* 劇屐 (_k(')ik(9)_) and 溺 (_nik(9)_), which are 陽入; see F1.78.
Based on this ordering, Williams has inferred that
the characters 隻, 蹠跖, and 炙 are read 陽入 _chik(9)_ (zik6).
However, since Fan Wan has separate series
for 直値殖植稙湜埴 (_chik(9)_) and 食蝕 (_shik(9)_),
it appears that its authors have attempted to distinguish
the vernacular rime _ek_ from the literary rime _ik_,
notwithstanding all series appear under 第七英影應益.
I have corrected Williams by placing 隻, 蹠跖, 炙, and 摭拓 under zek3 here.]]
