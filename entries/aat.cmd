  - Williams has the non-pawn senses under _(A/)p(8)_ [[aap3]]
    and the pawn senses under _(A/)t(8)_ [[aat3]].
    Whilst aap3 is expected from Middle Chinese 烏甲切,
    the common reading of 押 is aat3.
    Note that 押 is (probably) cognate with 壓,
    and while 壓 also has a Middle Chinese reading of 烏甲切,
    its modern reading as aat3 is uncontroversial.
  - Williams' 押韻: Changed Middle Chinese _wan(6)_ [[wan6]]
    to common reading _(5)wan_ [[wan5]].
