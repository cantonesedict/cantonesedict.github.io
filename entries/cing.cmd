  - For the character 秤, Fan Wan records
    level-tone _(1)ch(')ing_ (cing1) for the verb "weigh"
    and departing-tone _ch(')ing(3)_ (cing3) for the noun "scales".
    This is consistent with the classical tone distinction for 稱
    (level-tone verb and departing-tone noun),
    notwithstanding 《廣韻》 only records departing-tone for the character 秤.
  - In modern Cantonese usage, the verb "weigh" is nevertheless
    commonly read in departing tone as _ch(')ing(3)_ (cing3).
    Williams has also recorded departing-tone 稱 for the verb "weigh";
    it is unclear whether this is a mistake on his part
    or a deliberate attestation of (classical-violating) usage in Cantonese.
