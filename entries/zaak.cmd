  - This character (in the colloquial "weight/crush" senses) is commonly written 砸.
    In my opinion, 矺 is a better character to use than 砸 because:
    ++
    1. 矺 is attested in Middle Chinese
       with both reasonable sound and reasonable meaning
       (zaak3 from 《廣韻》陟革切, explained 磓也, to stone); and
    2. 砸 is otherwise read zaap3.
