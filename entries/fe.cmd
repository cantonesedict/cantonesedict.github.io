  - I have reluctantly assigned a Williams pronunciation of _f(e/)_ for modern fe1,
    but this is an anachronism, and perhaps inappropriate.
    Indeed in the original Williams entry for 炒, coffee is referred to as
    _(1)k(a/) (1)f(i/)_ (gaa1 fei1), not _k(a/)(3) (1)f(e/)_ (gaa3 fe1);
    see $炒caau2.
