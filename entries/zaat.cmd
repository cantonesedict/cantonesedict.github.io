  It is disputed whether gaat6 zaat6 is written 曱甴 or 甴曱
  (neither character appears in the Middle Chinese rime books).
  The form 曱甴 is commonly used, but the form 甴曱 is considered standard
  by [HK Education Bureau's Lexical Items]
  and by [《商務新字典》 (ISBN: 9620701402)][《商務新字典》].
  --
  --
  A [blog post by 陳凱文] has investigated this dispute.
  To paraphrase, his concluding points include that:
  --
  ++
  1. Based on the readings recorded in 《四聲篇海》, 《篇海類編》, and 《字彙補》,
     neither 曱甴 nor 甴曱 have an expected reading of exactly gaat6 zaat6,
     but 甴曱 is the reading with the greater discrepancy.
  2. It is possible that the form 甴曱 arose from a mistake by Eitel
     in parsing 反切 readings when looking up older [Chinese] sources,
     with modern dictionary editors following Eitel's form.
  3. The HK Education Bureau should not insist on the form 甴曱.
  ++
  --
  I concur with points~1 and~3 above.
  I disagree with point~2 above, because Eitel's work is based off of Williams',
  which had already used the form 甴曱 in 1856
  (notwithstanding Williams' reading is _(1)k(a/) ts(a/)t(9)_ (gaa1 zaat6)).
  --
  --
  Moreover, I am obliged to point out some inaccuracies in 陳凱文's post:
  --
  ++
  1. Whilst 陳凱文's text refers to the 1877 edition
     of Eitel's ''[A] Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese Dialect''
     (wherein 甴 is found under _K(a/)t(9)_ (gaat6) on [Page~^228][1877-甴])^,
     陳凱文's screenshot is actually of the *1910* edition of Eitel's dictionary
     *revised and enlarged by Immanuel Gottlieb Genähr*
     (wherein 甴 is found under _K(a/)t(9)_ (gaat6) on [Page~^330][1910-甴]).
  1. In my copy of [《商務新字典》], whose colophon has 9th~print, August~1996
     as the latest entry in the list of editions,
     the native reading for 甴 (on Page~^438, under Radical~⽥) is "〔駕壓切低入〕",
     not just "【駕壓切】" as written by 陳凱文.
     It is possible that this discrepancy is down to edition
     (but I note that the year 1992 referenced by 陳凱文 does not appear
     in the list of editions in the colophon of my edition).
     In any case, I do not believe that modern dictionary editors have
     "虛構出一個【駕壓切】" as claimed by 陳凱文.
     Instead, "〔駕壓切低入〕" in 《商務新字典》 is just a
     modern (i.e. *not* Middle Chinese) and native (i.e. *not* romanisation)
     but clumsy way of representing the reading gaat6.
