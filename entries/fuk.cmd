  - 《廣韻》 has four headline readings:
    ++
    1. 敷救切 _fau(3)_ (fau3) for the "cover" sense;
    2. 扶富切 _fau(6)_ (fau6) for the "soldiers lying in wait" sense;
    3. 芳福切 _fuk(7)_ (fuk1) for the "overturn" sense; and
    4. 匹北切 _p(')ak(7)_ (pak1) without explanation.
    ++
    The explanations for the first and third readings
    (i.e. _fau(3)_ (fau3) and _fuk(7)_ (fuk1)) refer to each other.
    It is unclear whether these are intended as mere cross-references
    or as genuine alternatives for those two senses.
  - In any case, Fan Wan _fau(6)_ (fau6) for the "cover" sense is incorrect,
    and should be _fau(3)_ (fau3) if one insists on the departing tone.
  - According to 段玉裁's annotations of 《說文》, the "cover" and "overturn" senses
    have the same olden reading 芳福切 _fuk(7)_ (fuk1),
    and distinguishing 敷救切 _fau(3)_ (fau3) for the "cover" sense
    is a southern reading (南音).
