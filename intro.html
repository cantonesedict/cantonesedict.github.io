<h2 id="canton"><a href="#canton" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>1. The Canton Dialect</h2>
<p class="williams">
The dialect of the Chinese language spoken most accurately in
the city of Canton <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廣州</span>)</ins>, and hence usually called the Canton Dialect, is
understood throughout the districts in the western half of the province
of Kwángtung <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廣東</span>)</ins>, with only unimportant exceptions. Though the
variations from the speech of the citizens of Canton itself and from
each other, heard in these districts are numerous, still the general
characteristics of the dialect in its idiom and pronunciation, are
preserved, and the people find little difficulty in talking with each
other. The people from the district of Sinhwui <span lang="zh-Hant">新會</span> lying south-
westerly from Canton, exhibit the most remarkable peculiarities
in pronunciation, and it is a puzzle to the scholars in the city
how they should have originated. The Canton dialect differs so
much from that spoken at the extreme east of the province, in
the department of Cháuchau <span lang="zh-Hant">潮州</span>, and in most parts of the adjoining
prefectures of Kiáying chau <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">嘉應州</span>)</ins> and Hwaichau fú <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">惠州府</span>)</ins>, that their
inhabitants are not intelligible to citizens of the capital. This
dialect, usually called the Tiéchiú from the local sound of <span lang="zh-Hant">潮州</span>,
and the Canton, constitute the speech of probably six sevenths of
the nineteen millions reckoned as the population of the whole province;
still this estimate is based on no very reliable data, owing to
the difficulty of actual examination. The patois known as the <i>kák-ká</i> <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">客家</span>)</ins>
approaches very near to the Canton, and people from Kwángsí <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廣西</span>)</ins>
are easily understood in this city. Both the Canton and Tiéchiú
dialects differ so materially in idiom and pronunciation from the
general language of China, called the <i>kwán hwá</i> <span lang="zh-Hant">官話</span> court or
mandarin dialect, that those speaking only the latter do not understand
them; and when they come to Canton as officers, are always
obliged to employ interpreters to explain to them the depositions
made in their courts by the common people.
