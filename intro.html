<h2 id="canton"><a href="#canton" class="permalink" aria-label="Permalink"></a>1. The Canton Dialect</h2>
<p class="williams">
The dialect of the Chinese language spoken most accurately in
the city of Canton <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廣州</span>)</ins>, and hence usually called the Canton Dialect, is
understood throughout the districts in the western half of the province
of Kwángtung <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廣東</span>)</ins>, with only unimportant exceptions. Though the
variations from the speech of the citizens of Canton itself and from
each other, heard in these districts are numerous, still the general
characteristics of the dialect in its idiom and pronunciation, are
preserved, and the people find little difficulty in talking with each
other. The people from the district of Sinhwui <span lang="zh-Hant">新會</span> lying south-
westerly from Canton, exhibit the most remarkable peculiarities
in pronunciation, and it is a puzzle to the scholars in the city
how they should have originated. The Canton dialect differs so
much from that spoken at the extreme east of the province, in
the department of Cháuchau <span lang="zh-Hant">潮州</span>, and in most parts of the adjoining
prefectures of Kiáying chau <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">嘉應州</span>)</ins> and Hwaichau fú <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">惠州府</span>)</ins>, that their
inhabitants are not intelligible to citizens of the capital. This
dialect, usually called the Tiéchiú from the local sound of <span lang="zh-Hant">潮州</span>,
and the Canton, constitute the speech of probably six sevenths of
the nineteen millions reckoned as the population of the whole province;
still this estimate is based on no very reliable data, owing to
the difficulty of actual examination. The patois known as the <i>kák-ká</i> <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">客家</span>)</ins>
approaches very near to the Canton, and people from Kwángsí <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廣西</span>)</ins>
are easily understood in this city. Both the Canton and Tiéchiú
dialects differ so materially in idiom and pronunciation from the
general language of China, called the <i>kwán hwá</i> <span lang="zh-Hant">官話</span> court or
mandarin dialect, that those speaking only the latter do not understand
them; and when they come to Canton as officers, are always
obliged to employ interpreters to explain to them the depositions
made in their courts by the common people.

The variations between the court and Canton dialects, in the
pronunciation of the great body of characters, are so regular as to
enable one to guess with a tolerable degree of certainty, what their
sounds are in the other, the more so because the variations are
chiefly in the finals, and not so numerous in the initials, as is the
case in some of the Fuhkien <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">福建</span>)</ins> patois. The unusual changes nearly
all occur in characters having the fourth tone <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">入聲</span> of Middle Chinese, not of modern Mandarin)</ins>. The most common
changes in the finals are here given:—

The frequency of the abrupt consonontal terminations <i>k</i>, <i>p</i>, and <i>t</i>,
in the Canton dialect, immediately strike a northerner from Kiángsú <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">江蘇</span>)</ins>,
who has been used to hear all terminations soft and flowing ; but
the people from those provinces are said to learn this dialect sooner
than those from Amoy <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">廈門</span>)</ins> and Fuhchau <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">福州</span>)</ins>, whose nasal sounds and
greater changes in the initials, are more difficult to accord with it.
Unlike what exists in the province of Fuhkien, here there is not so
great a difference between the language as spoken and read, as to
require almost the acquisition of a double medium.
</p>
<p class="williams">
The variations between the Tiéchiú and Canton dialects consist
in changes in both initials and finals, each having some sounds
which are unknown, or very uncommon in the other. For instance,
the initials <i>sh</i> or <i>f</i> are not found in the Tiéchiú, or the initials <i>b</i> <ins class="modern">(voiced [b], not voiceless [p])</ins>,
<i>lw</i>, or <i>mw</i> in the Canton; the oblique sound of <i>ù</i> in <i>turn</i> is one of
most common finals in the former, and one of the rarest in the latter;
there are no nasal sounds in the Canton, and no words ending with
the finals <i>iáng</i>, _iák, both of which are common in the Tiéchiú.
These differences are among the most noticeable between the two
leading dialects of this provkice, but the variations as one goes from
Cháuchau fú <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">潮州府</span>)</ins> westward to Canton city, are numberless, nearly every
village exhibiting some peculiarities in the sounds of a few words.

The standard of pronunciation for the Canton dialect is a small
duodecimo handbook, sometimes issued separately, but more frequently
combined with a letter-writer and forms of invitation, cards,
funeral eulogies, &amp;c., so that one may help to sell the other. It is
called <i>Kong-ú chʻik-tuk, Fan-wan tsʻüt-iú hòp tsáp</i>
<ins class="modern">(gong wu cik duk fan wan cyut jiu hap zaap)</ins> <span lang="zh-Hant">江湖尺牘分韻撮要合集</span>
Letters for Travelers and a Collection of
Important Characters divided by their Tones. The preface of the
work is a mere bookseller's recommendation, and gives no hints upon
the motives or principles which guided the compilers in arranging
the characters. It is as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote class="williams">
<ins class="modern">(See <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WO5WAAAAcAAJ&amp;newbks=0&amp;pg=PP5"><code>id=WO5WAAAAcAAJ</code> at Google Books</a> for the probable original Chinese.)</ins>
<p>
Books giving the sounds of characters, and forms for letter-writers,
are among the most common works in bookstores; but the
largest of them are so cumbrous and bulky as to be troublesome to
refer to, while the smaller kinds are too condensed to be satisfactory
for reference. Consequently, neither of them are well suited for
convenient use. Wú Hioh-pú of Yú-shán, and Wan Kʻi-shih of
Wú-kʻí have, however, jointly arranged a collection of words by
their tones, and an assortment of letters for the use of traders in
their travels, which are both comprehensive and brief, giving the
kernel of the matter. The two works assist each other; and as
they are not too large to carry about with one, they are also full and
easy of reference; for as it would be inexpedient to require the purchaser
to get two bulky books at a high price, they are now combined
into a single neat 'sleeve gem,' and arranged on the top and
bottom of the page; so that if one is in doubt respecting the meaning
of a character, he can readily look it up among the classes of
sounds; and if he does not know the exact sound, it will not be
troublesome to gather it from the reading. Thus one part of the
volume will help the other, like a carriage and a boat when one is
traveling by land and water, both having their appropriate uses and
position. Those who are learned will appreciate the propriety of
these remarks. A prefatory note.

This pocket dictionary is usually bound in four thin volumes, and
sold for twenty-five cents; it contains 7327 characters, and only 175 pages,
or on the average 42 to each page, which plainly shows how
<ins class="modern">(<a href="https://archive.org/details/tonicdictionaryo00will/page/n17/mode/1up">Page xii</a> here)</ins>
meagre are the definitions. In comparison with the local vocabularies
used at Amoy and Fuhchau, it is very imperfect, and proves the
ignorance of the compilers of what was wanted for a local dictionary,
or leads one to infer that they did not know how to prepare a
good one. There is no table of initials and finals as in those vocabularies,
nor any list of syllables, by combining which one can get
the proper sound of a character; for he who uses it, strangely enough,
is supposed to know already the sound of the character he is in
search of. The unwritten sounds or colloquial words used by the
people of Canton are nearly all omitted, which is one of the greatest
defects in it, and renders it far less useful to the foreigner who is
learning the dialect than those just spoken of. One reason, probably,
why so little notice is taken of these colloquial words in the Fan Wan <ins class="modern">(<span lang="zh-Hant">分韻</span>)</ins>
is the disregard the Cantonese pay to them in their writing, as
no one would degrade his composition by inserting them. This
rejection has had the result of keeping the greater part of them
unwritten, and the compilers of the Fan Wan, knowing no authorized
characters by which to express them, nor having any tabular
system of initials and finals in which to insert them so that the
student could find them, have omitted them. In fact, except in these
two ways, a Chinese actually has no possible means to express
a sound, and the latter mode is so clumsy and unsatisfactory that it
would probably be understood by few natives who use the book.
